## Our last buffet breakfast

This was our last day in a hotel with a buffet breakfast, the next place is an Airbnb. Luca stocked up on his 4 yogurts again and packed some little snacks for our long journey to KL today!

## Georgetown to Ipoh

<Travel items={["Georgetown","--BUS--","Ipoh"]} />

We decided a van would be better than flying because we wouldn't have to go through the hassle of the airport with the kids, the time was comparable and we could stop along the way whenever we wanted. It also means we get to see Ipoh along the way.

Our driver, Mr. Ng, picked us up from the hotel after breakfast, then we stopped by Mark and Bee's hotel to pick them up and began our 2.5 journey to Ipoh.

The drive was pretty pleasant and the kids were behaving themselves really well considering how long they had to sit still for! A nice big breakfast and plenty of distractions helped! The scenery was also pretty nice, very green!

## Ipoh

The sun was shining as we arrived in Ipoh, which also meant it was really hot in the sun! Ipoh is quite well known for its food and Lawrence had watched YouTube videos on this famous whole chicken here that is cooked in salt and sealed in a bag that you can then bring into other food courts and eat it with other side dishes, etc. So that was our first stop!

With our chicken in hand, Mr. Ng took us somewhere to eat it but it was really hot and there was so many people there! There was a pretty big queue so we waited with the kids in the shade but they were hot, tired and getting restless.

We eventually got a table and we ordered plenty of food, so much that we didn't end up eating our fancy chicken! It was actually a bit difficult with heat, queues, people everywhere and grumpy kids. Bella just wanted mama and was very lethargic. Luca was throwing tantrums and didn't want to eat, but he did see a blue bubble gun so we bought that and it kept him pretty well entertained for a while.

After taking turns eating and keeping the kids under control, we spent a little time going through some of the surrounding shops but the kids were getting pretty grumpy! We ended up buying them a mango icy pole and Luca stopped crying and very kindly shared it with Bella. The shop owner thought they were cute and gave them each a lollipop too, which was nice.

Thankfully it was time to hop in the car for our next leg of the journey to KL.

The kids must have been pretty exhausted so once we got in, we tried to make sure they were well hydrated and fed. Luca was quick to get into his free lollipop and we have then plenty of water, fruit and let them try a cold unsweetened soy milk drink too. Bella was pretty grumpy and ended up on Bec's lap while Luca was fairly content once we let him watch some videos on the tablet. Whatever works for this relatively long drive!

## Arriving at our airbnb

It was a long drive and Bella wasn't feeling well as she slept pretty much the whole car ride and didn't want to eat much. When we arrived at the place, the kids were cracking it, so with a lot of screaming, we checked in, picked up our keys and got the kids up to room.

It's definitely not like the hotels we've been staying at so far, it's a basic apartment and in a good location. The pictures look better than it is and there are little ants crawling around the kitchen which is a bit annoying but otherwise clean bed and basic bathroom. Luca and Bella didn't want much but we did heat up the famous whole chicken from Ipoh for dinner. Then we put the kids down fairly soon after that as Bella needed rest, then invited the others over to share the rest of the chicken once Azra was down too.

We then realised the aircon in the living area wasn't working so we contacted our host and pretty soon after we had a couple of technicians arrive to regas it!

## Checking out Jalan Alor

Lawrence looked after our kids and Celia looked after Azra so Mark, Bee, Bec and myself could check out the night market which was close by. We had a late supper of chicken wings, coconuts and satays.

Then ended with durian chendol for dessert. It was nice to check out the buzzing nightlife of KL. We're in a great location here.
