## Buffet breakfast

My fever seems to have calmed down a bit, although I'm still pretty congested.

The kids slept through again, thankfully! This hotel room has a second, much smaller bedroom attached, which we just fit the portacot in. This means we can put them to bed and not have to sit in silence and dark for the rest of the evening.

We headed down for breakfast and place is a lot smaller than Park Royal, so there was less to choose from but they have a menu on the table which is all included and they make everything fresh, including omelettes, kaya toast and a bunch of other stuff which was pretty good!

## Street art

We decided to go for a walk to see the street art. Luckily the weather was fairly overcast when we walked up. We borrowed a wheelchair from the hotel so Bella sat on Lawrence's lap and Luca in the other pram.

The architecture is cool here and I liked the street art. Luca spotted ice-cream and it was so hot so on the way back we decided to get ice-cream and coconuts.

After ice-cream the kids cracked it, it was probably the heat. So Bella refused to sit in the wheelchair with Lawrence so Bec carried her back and Luca was screaming in the pram for Bec too.

All sweaty, we made it back and just planned to relax for the rest of the day.

## (Not so) quiet time

Bella was a struggle to get down but eventually slept for a decent amount and I took the opportunity to have a nap too!

Bec took Luca to Lawrence and Celia's room where Mark and Bee were over from their hotel with tambun biscuits, which is one of the things this area is famous for.

Around 2:30-3:00, Bella woke up and was super grumpy! She threw another massive tantrum, similar to the one from the plane ride over. Even once Bec and Luca were back, nothing was calming her down. Eventually Bec and Luca went swimming and I stayed back to try to calm her. It took quite a while but when she was finally ready, we went to join the others in the pool.

## Afternoon swim

We spent the rest of the afternoon up until dinner in the pool and the kids were happy.

## Kaka for dinner

For dinner, we saw there was a Japanese restaurant really close to our hotel that had good reviews called "kaka ramen club" and thought we'd give it a go and it was really nice! It's been years since I've had ramen, I ordered char siew ramen and it was delicious! We also got soft shell crab fried ramen, a separate serve of char siew for Luca and gyoza to share.
