## Finishing up in Batu Ferringhi

The good news is the kids slept all the way through the night for the first time here! The bad news is I only got 4 hours sleep as I've had fever, a headache and a few other symptoms ðŸ˜ž

Bec took the kids down to breakfast earlier and then kids club in the morning while I tried to catch-up on some sleep. Pretty disappointed to be sick on our first international holiday in so long!

I managed to get downstairs to catch the end of breakfast by 10:30 but didn't want to sit under air conditioning, so I sat outside in the warmth and saw the ravens collecting all the scraps from the plates. Bec would have hated it!

## Grab to Georgetown

<Travel items={["Batu Ferringhi ","--TAXI--","Georgetown "]} />

We got a late check-out, which was very helpful and then organised a couple of Grabs to Georgetown. Took about half an hour to drive over with the kids on our lap (which felt a bit strange).

## Arriving at our hotel in Georgetown

We arrived at our hotel and as our room wasn't ready we went to get our complimentary hotel drink. A few of us got fresh watermelon juice, which Bella loved, and Luca got a hot chocolate which he loved too. We then tried to get Bella to sleep although her nap was way overdue and then gave up and Bec took them swimming with her parents.

The pool had an awesome view and the kids had a ball and Luca didn't want to leave.

## Local dinner

As the kids were pretty tired and Bella didn't nap we decided we wouldn't join the rest at the place they were going as it was a 20 minute drive away. Instead we decided to just go to somewhere local around our hotel.

Steve looked on google maps and we found a little cafe called Bistro Tang with a heritage frontage. It was cute inside and also a place you could stay. We just ordered satay and some noodles. Luca was already sleeping when we got there but we woke him when the food came. There were toys for the kids to play with which they enjoyed and liked to explore the place.

We walked back (Bec carried Luca for half of it) and settled the kids to sleep and have an early night.
