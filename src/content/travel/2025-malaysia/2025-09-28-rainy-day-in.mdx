## Another buffet breakfast

It was raining all night and the forecast looked like it would last a while, do we planned a quiet morning. We spent most of the morning at breakfast and packed the kids lunch boxes with some food for later, although one of the staff said we're not supposed to do that! After Luca had tried the donut yesterday, we thought he'd ask for more but he mostly wanted yoghurt, bread and fruit!

After an upset stomach last night, I kept breakfast a bit closer to my usual diet, with the addition of fruit but I did tried a couple of new foods: beef bacon and a Malaysian beef lung, both very tasty!

## Gym and kids club

I never go to the gym on holidays, but my back was a bit tight so I thought I'd go down and see if they had a foam roller. Mark, Bee and Lawrence were there working out, so I did a little workout too and Bec took the kids down to kids club to play and do a butterfly craft activity.

I headed down to meet them and introduced Luca to Mario kart! It's a good one for little kids because you can enable auto driving, auto steering, etc. I'm not sure he understood what was actually happening but he seemed to like it.

## Nap time and an afternoon swim

Bella took nearly an hour to get to sleep but actually slept afterwards, which was great. Luca was happy just snacking and watching Thomas the tank on the tablet.

Once Bella was up, the rain had stopped although it was really overcast but either way we headed for the pool until dinner time. We saw a bunch of squirrels running around the trees by the pool and Luca was fascinated by these black and yellow centipedes, to the point where when it was time to go to dinner, he was in tears because he would miss the centipedes!

The only other thing we did was explore the Amazonia Splash area, which was really cool, there were jets of water and buckets that would automatically fill and tip over to make big splashes. Luca was not a fan and was pretty scared but Bella wouldn't let me leave and just wanted to watch it "more"!

## Dinner

For dinner we went down the road, only a couple of minutes walk. We ended up at a different place to what we had planned but there were lots of fans inside which made it all worth it! Along the way we saw quite a few monkeys, they sound like a bit of a nuisance around here, they had to close the outdoor part of kids club for a bit because of them. When we arrived, we ordered a bunch of local dishes to share with some non-spicy ones for me and the kids. We ordered a couple of coconuts too and the kids (and us adults) loved them! So refreshing in the warm weather.

Pretty quiet day today but this will be our last night in Batu Ferringhi as tomorrow we head out to Georgetown for a few nights.
