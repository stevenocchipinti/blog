## Breakfast in the apartment

Bella woke up slightly warmer, sick and not her usual self so we had a fairly quiet morning and let the kids sleep in.

The kids just had mandarins and Luca had his yoghurt. Then my parents came over with Azra. My brother wanted to get a coffee at a shop 2 minutes away so my dad, Steve and Luca joined but Luca just got a watermelon juice. I stayed back and lied with Bella and she still was quite lethargic.

## Lunch with Nisha

We all walked down to a mall about 10 minutes walk away to meet my cousin and Aunty for lunch.

The walk wasn't the most kid friendly with prams as there were hardly any full pavements and there was a bit of road walking.

We finally arrived at the mall and met at a restaurant called Amazonas which serves South American food. My Aunty organised a variety of food including Ceviche, tacos, croquettes, plantain and guacamole, Wagyu fried rice and chicken. During the lunch Bella got quite tired so we took her in the pram for a walk to fall asleep for her nap and Luca also needed to run around so he came exploring the mall.

When it was time for dessert my Aunty ordered churros and chocolate sauce as well as ice-cream with popping candy for Luca. When Luca heard dessert was on the way he was back in the restaurant in no time!

Bella was sleeping for this part of it but when we had to leave Luca decided to wake her up and then she just wanted me to carry her.

## Shopping at uniqlo

Some of us wanted to check out uniqlo for some basics. I walked there but sat with Bella instead as she was quite clingy and still not feeling great. So we just waited by ourselves and then mum joined.

When the rest joined us Steve, Luca, dad, mum, Bella and myself decided to walk home and Mark, Bee and Azra continued on shopping.

## Dinner with Ee Song

My parents old friend who looked after Rachael when I was being born came to meet my parents. He popped by the apartment and we joined them for dinner as it was so close by.

The kids enjoyed the food too and Bella seemed to have more energy and her appetite back which was great. Mark and Bee joined quite a while later to say hi to Ee Song so we only have a slight crossover as we left earlier so we could get the kids in bed but it was great for me and my family to meet Ee Song.

## Bedtime

We put the kids down and while we weren't super impressed with this accommodation, Luca told us he likes this place, but that's probably because this is the biggest bed he's ever slept in and he enjoys arranging the pillows!
