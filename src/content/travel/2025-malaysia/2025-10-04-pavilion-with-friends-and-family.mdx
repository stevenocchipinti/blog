## Cafe breakfast

Instead of waiting for lunch, we decided to go to a cafe around the corner called The Lemon Tree, not realising it was inside a Park Royal hotel, which made us miss the a Park Royal we stayed in.

We shared a little food so we still had room for lunch at Pavilion, where we were meeting with Bec's friends.

## Oriental Kopi

The queue for Oriental Kopi was huge (see the first photo below) and the kids were pretty exhausted but after a long wait, we finally got a table big enough for our group.

We were meeting Bec's work friend Donovan and his kids but most of the kids were not happy ð.

It didn't take long for the kids to get super restless though, at one point there they both wanted to be on Bec's lap and it all felt very chaotic! I ended up putting on some YouTube for Luca to calm him down which I would usually avoid, but we were getting desperate!

Once they calmed down a little, we thought we'd offer Luca a treat, a Milo dinosaur! I shared it with him and he loved it!

Once we finished lunch, we walked around the shops together for a little then parted ways before the kids exploded again!

## Museum of Illusions

We saw this place on Google maps and thought we'd check it out on the way home and try to keep the kids entertained for a bit. It cost 50 ringgit per adult and the kids were free. It wasn't bad, Luca loved the tunnel, where we walked on bridge through a dark tube of rotating lights, which made us adults feel really dizzy but the kids seemed fine and wanted to go though over and over again!

There were a few cool photo spots too, with instructions on how to make the illusion work and helpful staff to take our pictures for some of it.

The moodiness was beginning to fire up again so we headed home after this.

## Intermission

After a big half day of pretty upset kids (particularly Bella), we headed home and Bella was screaming the whole way.

We were all exhausted so we just let the kids watch as much TV as they wanted, we just needed to rest. Luca watched quite a bit and then Bella got her energy back again but then had crying fits where she only wanted Bec.

Bec really needed a nap so I took Bella against her will and gave Bec a short break but then soon after that Luca wet his pants and so we needed to get Bec out. Celia wanted to help before with the kids but Bella only wanted Bec.

We quickly did a load of washing and then got some stickers out for the kids and Bella had a bath, only because she kept asking for it and by this stage we'd do anything to get them to calm down.

We had to head to dinner soon back in the Pavilion mall except we were wondering whether it was worth it given the way the kids were (crying and looking) but we pushed through as my Aunty was taking us out and I hadn't seen my uncle and cousin yet.

On the way there, Luca fell asleep and Bella seemed fine and was just hungry.

## Fancy dinner at Canton Court

It took us a bit of time to find the restaurant in the shopping centre but when we did we were taken to a private room as it is quite a fancy Chinese restaurant. Luca was still asleep so we left him in a corner and Bella was suddenly wanting to be her social self and say hi and explore. They ordered fried rice for the kids initially as we warned them we'd probably leave early given how grumpy the kids had been. Bella ate quite a bit in the end. We woke Luca up but he was not interested and very grumpy.

The food was nice, the prawns were very fresh. There was steamed fish, fried pigeon, pork broth and a braised pork fried rice. We got to eat most of this but as the kids were getting tired they packed some fried rice and braised pork rice for us. Luca was particularly grumpy and wanted to leave even after getting a watermelon juice. Bella ate heaps and was happy socialising but I know she was tired.

## Bedtime

Today was definitely one of the harder days with the kids! We finally got them down for bed and a few minutes later, Luca ran out of the room and Bella started crying. We quickly put them back in bed and tried to explain that it's very important they stay in bed. Then, as our luck today would have it, a couple of minutes later there were fireworks right outside our building that were exploding at about the height of our apartments on the 20th floor! It was so loud, it sounded like a war zone! And to make things worse, we didn't even have a good angle to see them, just the reflection off the building next to us. I was expecting Luca to come running out again with such a loud noise but amazingly he didn't, even after asking about fireworks today! There have been a lot of fireworks on our trip and I have no idea what any of them have been for. Possibly the mid-autumn festival, which is the day we flying back.

Once the kids were down Steve and I finished our dinner with some takeaway from the restaurant we just left.
