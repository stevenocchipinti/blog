## Buffet breakfast

The kids slept pretty well, they were exhausted! Although Bella woke up at her usual time of 6:30am Melbourne time, which was 4:30am here and didn't want to go back to sleep but otherwise it was fine.

We finally got a chance to check out the place a little on the way to breakfast and it's really nice here!

The breakfast spread was also pretty impressive. Luca loaded up on fruit and yoghurt but he also had a donut and roti bread for the first time.

## Morning swim and kids club

After breakfast, we got back to our room and got ready for a swim. The kids didn't really want to go anywhere but after spotting some monkeys outside from our balcony, they were a bit more open to getting out. The monkeys were pretty far away and I couldn't get my phone in time for a photo though.

The pool area was really nice, there were plenty to choose from including a family pool with a volley ball net, soccer goals and two big water slides. It was right on the beach and there were cold water stations everywhere.

After playing in the pool for a bit, throwing a ball around, Bella was getting really tired so Bec took her back to the room, which set Luca off! He was crying for ages and could only manage to say "mama" over and over, so after a walk around the beach to try to calm him down, we went up to the room too.

Bec put Bella to bed but she was pretty unsettled too. Luca and I had showers then Bec took Luca to the kids club while I tried to resettle Bella.

On the way out, Luca saw some more monkeys out the window in the hallway and ran back to tell me so we could get a photo. Not the best photos but it's pretty cool the hotel is surrounded by monkeys.

First Luca was crying for "mama", then Bella was crying for "mama" and not sleeping. I think the flight and messed up sleep routine has made these episodes a bit worse but they are having fun here otherwise.

## Kids club

As Bella wasn't sleeping, after a few resettles, I ended up getting her up, had a snack and headed down to kids club to meet Bec and Luca.

It's a pretty good setup, they have regular art and craft classes, a slide that goes into a ball pit, a bunch of toys, tv and Mario kart!

The kids did a leaf painting workshop, where they painted the back of a leaf and stamped it onto the page and then Luca started building a house out of giant Lego-like brings but once one brick fell off, he just had fun wrecking the whole thing

## Nap and dinner

Bec went up to have a little nap and luckily the grandparents, Mark and Bee came to the kids club so I could get in a quick nap before dinner too.

Just as I got in to bed, my stomach felt a bit off, probably from the pretty drastic change of diet for me so I didn't get a rest in but then I swapped with Bec and she went with the family to dinner while I stayed back for a nap.

Bec wrote the rest of this blog.

Feeling a bit more refreshed I came to meet the rest of the family at snake show where Luca touched a snake!

Afterwards we had a pretty quick dinner at the restaurant in the resort. Dad really wanted the buffet and so Mark did it too. The rest of us got Malaysian dishes. It was pretty rushed and the kids were exhausted so I took the food takeaway for me to eat later. The kids had some of the buffet food and Luca loved the chicken satay and Bella loved the barramundi.

After a quick shower the kids went down with any noise at all. They were exhausted!
