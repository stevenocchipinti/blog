## Local breakfast

We woke up and decided to stay close to the hotel as much as we could for the morning and just across the road is a 24-7 restaurant that send to always be busy! It was very cheap and Mark and Bee had taken Azra there for her first Kaya toast so we thought we'd give it a go. We bought Kaya toast and watermelon juice, which has been a pretty regular breakfast for us here!

After that, we headed back up to the apartment and prepared to go to the closest shops to get some supplies for trip home tomorrow. Of all the shopping complexes, Lot 10 was the closest so we headed there.

## Lot 10

Lot 10 had a food court at the bottom and some fairly basic kid friendly attractions on some of the other floors. There was some play equipment and a little arcade and we bought a few tokens for Luca to try some games.

There are a bunch of Japanese stores here too, including a Don Don Donki where we bought a sweet potato for the kids (that they didn't eat) and an Isetan where we bought some watermelon, milk bread, salted egg fish skins and lunch (yakitori, croquet, mackerel and gyoza).

It was a little hit and miss with the kids, they had their moments but the time to play around was good to help them get some energy out.

## Quiet time

When we got back, Bec mentioned she saw a lizard run behind the mirror in our bathroom. Luca saw a squished one on the side of the road a few days back and keeps asking me everyday where he can see another one, so he was very excited about this. We searched around for a while and eventually it ran out and across the wall really quickly, we didn't get the best photo of it but it made Luca's day.

The kids watched a bit more TV and we heated up all the left over food and ate it with our Isetan food as this will pretty much be the last meal we'll have here as dinner was going to be with Donovan's family tonight.

We also let Luca shoot his bubble gun out the window of the apartment, which he loved, haha.

## Afternoon at Donovan's

Donovan came to pick us up in the afternoon after Bella's nap. His house was about 20 minutes drive away and when we got there the kids got pretty excited to play with all the toys and then they saw the pool and we all got in.

Claire ordered pizzas for everyone and they were really nice wood fired ones. They also heated up some nuggets initially. It was nice to see the kids having fun with each other and a more relaxing space to catch-up with the kids happier.

Donovan dropped us home and we'll see him again in November when he's down with the family then.

## Packing

We finally got the kids down and started getting things ready to go. Can't say we'll miss this accommodation, it was a great location and nice having a kitchen, laundry and bath but nowhere near as comfortable as our previous hotels (it was also a fraction of the price).

It's got it's fair share of quirks too, like the "no cooking" sign in the kitchen, the replacement "plug" for the bath, light switches to cut the power to the hot water service and air conditioners, lack of hand towels and laundry detergent to go with the washing machine, regular loud fireworks that we can't see (happened again tonight) and ants running around everywhere.
