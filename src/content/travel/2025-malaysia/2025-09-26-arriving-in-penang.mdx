## Early start

After prepping so much stuff for the kids, including a lunchbox each, homemade lychee gummies, a new Android tablet loaded up with media and games, we packed 2x suitcases and 3 carry-ons, most of which was probably food and nappies!

The gummies were really simple to make too: 350ml of 100% lychee juice and 4 tablespoons to gelatin. Let it sit until it blooms, warm up, mix and pour into a mould, them let it set in the fridge for a couple of hours.

We left the house around 3am to drive to my parents, then get a lift with our car with car seats for the kids to airport. The kids were tired and we thought they'd sleep in the car but they did not... At all.

Because Lawrence was using a wheelchair and we had the seats with extra leg room, we got priority boarding, got seated right next to the door and were first off at the other end. This was all very handy with kids, especially the extra leg room! Lifesaver!

Thankfully, the prep paid off because they were constantly wanting something different every for of minutes, but we were prepared for everything and it worked pretty well. Luca even enjoyed his first real video games ("Lucas and friends" series of Android apps are almost the only ones I could find without ads).

There was only about 30 minutes worth of chaos where both kids were crying uncontrollably and very loudly! It was the time the seatbelt light was on due to some light turbulence so we couldn't even move them but they did do really well!

One lady came over during that time (while the seatbelt sign was on) and tried to help by grabbing random stuff from our bag and shaking it in her face, which was well intentioned but I think it just scared her more ð

## Getting through KL

After a little over 8 hours of flying, we arrived in KL. The kids were exhausted and pretty grumpy, the connecting flight was delayed and getting through the airport was actually kind of tough, KL airport is pretty big!

After some snacks and toilet breaks, we boarded our next flight, which was only an hour and the kids both did great, considering how little they had slept today! We had pre ordered a sweet taro floss bun which the kids enjoyed.

## Arriving in Penang

Getting out of the airport was pretty straight forward and we headed to our driver for the final leg of the trip.

We had another hour of driving and thankfully the kids all feel asleep for the ride. They had been up from 3am to roughly 10pm Australian time!

## Park Royal

We arrived at Park Royal in Batu Ferringhi and Luca was still sleeping, so we decided not to go anywhere for dinner and just check in, have our welcome drink and get them sorted for bed. We ended up eating the leftovers from the kids for dinner (biltong, gummies, sweet potato, fruit, etc.) and had a couple of the welcome treats waiting for us in our room.

The place looks really nice but we're all too exhausted to appreciate it properly tonight, so we're off to bed and will look around and post some photos tomorrow.
