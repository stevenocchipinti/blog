## Early start

After prepping so much stuff for the kids, including a lunchbox each, homemade lychee gummies, a new Android tablet loaded up with media and games, we packed 2x suitcases and 3 carry-ons, most of which was probably food and nappies!

We left the house around 3am to drive to my parents, then get a lift with our car with car seats for the kids to airport. The kids were tired and we thought they'd sleep in the car but they did not... At all.

Because Lawrence was using a wheelchair and we had the seats with extra leg room, we got priority boarding, got seated right next to the door and were first off at the other end. This was all very handy with kids, especially the extra leg room! Lifesaver!

Thankfully, the prep paid off because they were constantly wanting something different every for of minutes, but we were prepared for everything and it worked pretty well. Luca even enjoyed his first real video games ("Lucas and friends" series of Android apps are almost the only ones I could find without ads).

There was only about 30 minutes worth of chaos where both kids were crying uncontrollably and that was the time the seatbelt light was on due to some light turbulence and because they were exhausted so we couldn't even move them but they did do really well!

## Getting through KL

After a little over 8 hours of flying, we arrived in KL. The kids were exhausted and pretty grumpy, the connecting flight was delayed and getting through the airport was actually kind of tough, KL airport is pretty big!

After some snacks and toilet breaks, we boarded our next flight, which was only an hour and the kids both did great, considering how little they had slept today! We had pre ordered a sweet taro floss bun which the kids enjoyed. Getting out of the airport was pretty straight forward and we headed to our driver for the final leg of the trip.

## Arriving in Penang

We had another hour of driving and thankfully the kids all feel asleep for the ride. They had been up from 3am to roughly 10pm Australian time!

## Park Royal

We arrived at Park Royal in Batu Ferringhi and Luca was still sleeping, so we decided not to go anywhere for dinner and just check in, have our welcome drink and get them sorted for bed. We ended up eating the leftovers from the kids for dinner (biltong, gummies, sweet potato, fruit, etc.) and had a couple of the welcome treats waiting for us in our room.
