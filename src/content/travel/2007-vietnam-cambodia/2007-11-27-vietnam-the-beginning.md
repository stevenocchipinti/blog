On Friday I'm going to Vietnam!!!  
I thought I'd try to keep a blog going for this trip, its never worked for me in the past, but I thought Id give it ago.  
In this blog im going to try to post as many photos as I can, providing this site lets me :)

Anyway, to kick things off, this is the group im going with (except one absent member, Nina):

On the trip ill be working on an "evolutionary art project". For us, this means programming and photography.  
Our project is based on an existing "mosaic program" and our goal is to use this is to do creative things.  
For us programmers, our main goal is to extend the code, make it more efficient, more features, a user interface, etc.

Here is an example of the end product (printed as a poster, photo taken by my camera phone):

To accomplish this, the program needs a target image and a tileset (shown above).

Anyway, this is just a sneak preview for more to come.  
Stay tuned!
