Today was an easy day.  
We did a little shopping and finally found a place that sells Midori!  
Ever since we saw how cheap alcohol was, we have been looking for Midori to make QF's. We asked taxi drivers, liquor shops, markets, and randoms, but we couldn't find it anywhere, then we just happen to walk down a small street near our hotel and finally found it! I also got this 9lt water bottle with a little tap on it that worked really well.  
That night we had a little drink up, but nothing compared to Day 11!
