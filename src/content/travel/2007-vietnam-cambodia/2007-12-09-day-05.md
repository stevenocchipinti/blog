Today we all went to RMIT again. We all worked fairly productively and planned out some future work.  
At this stage for the project, the program is only black and white, so today, AB explained a strategy we could use to support color in the future so we can start working on and researching it.  
Some of our group headed down to the student cafe area and set up our "photo booth" in the lobby which was a success.

There were alot of students who were interested in what we were doing and looking at our sample mosaics. We took a whole bunch of random photos home to process.

When we got back to the hotel, we all headed up to Paco and my hotel room to do a "batch processing session".  
It was a really good night. We all helped each other get the software going and processing, and as it takes along time to actually process, we all just kicked back, ate pizza and drunk cheap booze.

Oh yea, and it rained! for about 30 seconds, we all crowded around the window to see this amazing sight. I walked away to get my camera, and by the time I got back, the rain had stopped, and there wasnt many people around the window, but you get the idea :)
