Today I was feeling very sick. Most people went to RMIT today to work and came back a little earlier than normal, except 4 people who stayed there till very late, a couple of others took the day off today and caught up on some rest, shopping and photography. I got to bed around 9:30ish last night, so today I stayed back at the hotel and slept in till about 9:15. I had breakfast (which finishes at 9:30) and went back to my room. At about 2:30 I was so hungry, so I went out to our usual lunch place with a few other people who were actually at the hotel rather than RMIT. The luch place is called Pho 2000 and I got one of my favourite meals, a nice and basic meal :) see below.

_Chicken, flavoured rice, lettuce, cucumber, tomato, carrots, white carrots and one chili_

From there, because I was actually up and about, I went for a walk with my group to the market. I did a little bit of shopping and then returned to the hotel just in time for the 6:30 meeting. After the long, but productive meeting, we went out to a fancy restaurant. A very nice place and they had the english word "fanny" everywhere, I thought it was the name of the restaurant, but was later informed that it was called "The Temple". The other thing about this place was they had a "western corner" on the menu. I was still feeling pretty sick, and I didnt have an appetite so I ordered "fish and chips" which was a small meal, and couldnt even eat 1/4 of it.

When we met up with the four people that stayed at RMIT (AB, Mike, Lee and Ralph) they informed us that they had basically cracked the problem of color and had written some great scripts to make things happen automatically. So although I didnt have a very productive day, alot of work got done today at uni.
