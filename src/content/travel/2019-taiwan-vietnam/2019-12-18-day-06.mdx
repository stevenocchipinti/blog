## Big buffet breakfast

As there is not much choice for food around here and the buffet breakfast got good reviews and is included with our stay, we decided to eat big this morning!

The selection was quite good, everything from soup, fish, vegetables and dumplings to bacon, eggs, croissants, salads and a good selection of beads. They also had cakes and fruit to finish it off.

We pretty much tried a bit of everything between us but Bec mainly had the healthy stuff.

## Hot Springs

The weather has turned, it's been raining all day and while all the mist looks nice from inside, Bec was pretty disappointed we didn't get to go out and explore the national park so we ended up spending time in the outdoor hot springs around the resort and chilling out in our room until dinner.

After resting in the room we didn't feel that hungry and we're too lazy to go to the restaurant as the weather was still bad. So for dinner we decided to eat our typical dessert on this trip; banana and almonds!
