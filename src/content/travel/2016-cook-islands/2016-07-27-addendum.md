This trip has been everything I could have wanted and more. When I was planning
it, I had some goals:

- Relax! The main purpose of this trip was to de-stress.
- Do something new and outside my comfort zone.
- Work on my extroversion - talk to everyone!
- Have fun!

This was the longest trip I've been on by myself and I can confidently say I
achieved all my goals. I didn't want to feel rushed with a full agenda of
activities, but at the same time I didn't want to be completely unprepared or
not leave the hotel - I wanted to experience the island!

In preparation for the trip, I created this list, knowing that it didn't matter
if I didn't do any of them and if I felt like sleeping all day or walking by the
beach I would do that, but when I felt like doing something more interesting, I
was ready.

## The List

- Get a Local Motorbike Licence
- Hire a Scooter
- Kite Surfing
- Kayaking
- Photography
  - There's a waterfall
  - The sky will be really clear - try star trails!
- Buggy Tour
- Scuba Diving
- Stand Up Paddleboarding (SUP)
- Lagoon Tour (glass bottom boat)
- Party Bus
- Massage
- Punanga Nui Markets (in Avarua)
- Muri Night Market
- Cultural Night - Dinner and Show
- Coco putt (mini golf at a really good restaurant)
- Try Ika Mata (raw fish in coconut cream)
- Light Up SUP, Night Lagoon Tour
- Paddleboard Yoga

I managed to do all of this, except for the last two!

## Prices

I always refer back to my blogs to see how much stuff costs and I never include
prices, so now this trip gets it own pricing section!

- **The Black Pearl accommodation** (14 nights): **$1932 NZD**
- **JetStar flights** (MEL -> AKL -> RAR -> AKL -> MEL): **$890 AUD**

## Key Points

Just like in previous blogs, I thought I'd do a summary post of some of the
things that stood out to me or stuck in my memory. This should help with
planning future trips (because I definitely want to go back!)

- **Kia Orana** == hello
- **Nu** == coconut
- **The Black Pearl** was nice accommodation, although Muri seems more central
- Winter is pretty good here, **rains a fair bit** but normally not for too long at a time
- Chickens, dogs and geckos everywhere! But especially **chickens!** ...beach chickens
- Bus drivers are really entertaining - **take a bus!**
- **Scooter licence** requires more effort than I first thought. The written test
  requires local knowledge and practical test requires the ability to ride
  slowly around cones without your feet touching the ground. Make sure to have a
  read of the "Road Code" before doing to the exam, the rules are different to
  Australia.
- Scooting around the island is so awesome - definitely **get a scooter!**
- The **water is still a bit cold** this time of year, so it requires some
  adjustment time, but it's not too bad.
- **Groceries are expensive** - not too bad, but more than I expected
- **Jet blast area** is not like [the ad](https://youtu.be/F0DWNv3qAeM?t=4m19s)
- So many **kiwis!**
- More **families, older people and couples** than younger party goers (still some)
- **5 digit** phone numbers
- **Food** is awesome, common food are:
  - **BBQ meats** with tomato or mushroom sauce
  - **Chop Suey** (noodles)
  - **Rakau** (Rarotongan spinach aka taro leaves soaked in coconut cream)
  - Home made **desserts**
  - **Prawns**
  - **Marlin**
  - **Ika Mata** (raw fish with coconut cream)
  - Really nice **bread** (normally bakery fresh)
- Local beer is **Matutu**, they have a pale ale and a lager
- **Weather report** is generally not to be trusted and changes regularly, although
  windguru.co.nz did a pretty good job of predicting the wind a week ahead for
  kite surfing
- **Animals don't try to kill you here**, most things are safe, including
  swimming in the lagoon, the sharks are on the other side of the reef!
- **Power points** are the same as Australia
- Uses **New Zealand money**, with the addition of the **Cook Islands Triangle coins!**
