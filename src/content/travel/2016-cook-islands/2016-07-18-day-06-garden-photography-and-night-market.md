This morning I made bacon and eggs again for breakfast and had a fairly quiet,
relaxed morning. I was eating out the front of the villa and admiring the garden
bed outside my room so I thought I'd take some photos, this made me want to do
more photography!

Along the way from the hotel to Muri beach I saw a sign that pointed to some
gardens, so I packed my bag with photography gear, put my tripod on my back
and tried to find that sign. There were dark clouds and it was very lightly
raining, but I was already half way there so I just kept going.

I hadn't seen the sign yet, but along the way I thought I'd see what the side
roads were like. So far I had only been on the main road that goes around the
island, but there was an inner road and the odd side road which was more
residential. There were small houses, farms and animals walking around. It was
cool to see this side of the island rather than just the more touristy side with
hotels, shops and beaches. The side roads were made of mostly dirt and rock, but
scooter wasn't exactly designed for off-road, but I managed get through the
muddy hills ok.

After this little detour, I made it back to the main road and eventually found
the gardens. It was a nice walk into and through the gardens and there were
signs for the "Hidden Spirit Cafe". I was pretty hungry and it was still lightly
raining, so decided to get some food first.

I ordered a delicious fruit and chicken salad with coconut Mayo. The waiter was
telling me how they pride themselves on using only the freshest ingredients from
around the island. The meal was light and really refreshing, probably my
favourite meal here so far!

After lunch I walked around the gardens and took a few photos.

After spending a little time here, I thought I was already half way to Muri so I
may as well go there for a bit. The weather had cleared up and the sun was
shining, so I stopped at a fishing pier to put some sunscreen on.

I stopped at KiteSUP to enquire about kite surfing lessons, they were a little
more expensive than I was expecting, but I took a brochure to have a think about
it. They said that the wind should pick up by around Thursday so I have some
time to think about it.  
This place also offered "paddleboard yoga"! They have classes on Wednesday
morning, it was a bit early but I was keen to give that a go so I booked it!

From here I went a bit further down the road and saw a massage place, it looked
ok so I enquired there too. The other big attraction in Muri is the night
market. There was still a bit of time before it started so I stopped by LBV
Bakery for a little snack and a cup of tea. I had read about LBV Bakery, KiteSUP
and the night market during my research so it was good to see these places
with my own eyes. I sat outside in the sun and had my muffin and tea while I
watched the chickens running around everywhere.

After relaxing here for a bit, I thought I could probably use that massage
after all and rode back to the shop. I got a back, neck and shoulders massage
and then went back to the night market area and waited around for it to get
started.

As everything was being setup, I got speaking to one of the people that was
setting up a stall and it sounds like these markets are pretty popular. I got
directions to the nearest ATM to get some cash out for dinner (the ATM fee was
$5.50!) and by the time I got back the market was in full swing.  
The market had a lot of options for dinner and some very tempting home made
desserts! I ended up getting a Marlin salad, berry smoothie and choc-berry
brownie - very tasty!

As the sun was setting, the temperature was getting a bit colder and I realised
I didn't bring my jumper or a helmet and the ride home wouldn't be very
enjoyable. The wind from the ride makes it much colder! I ended up using my
sunglasses as goggles so I could see where I was going!

I got home and ended up preparing some burger patties to cook up on the BBQ at
some point and then had a little nap. When I woke up I had a shower and read my
book before going to bed.
