Today I slept in until 3pm! I was exhausted! It's all catching up with me.
Every time I woke up the soothing sound of the rain outside would put me back to
sleep. I ended up staying in bed for quite a while and started reading the
material in the hotel that explained the services available and some facts about
the area including what to do and where to eat.

There was also wifi available at the hotel, but it cost $9 for 30MB! This didn't
bother me too much because part of my goal for this trip was to disconnect and
properly relax, so I wanted to stay off the internet anyway and with prices like
that, it wasn't hard to avoid!

By this time I was starting to get hungry, but because I had basically slept the
whole day, by the time I left it was already dark and still raining outside.

The book said there was places to get food to the left or right of the hotel.
I picked right, walked for a while in the dark and rain with an umbrella. There
were quite a few dogs barking at me as I went past. Not quite the image I had in
mind for a nice Island holiday.

Eventually I found an inn, but could only see accommodation rooms not the
restaurant, so I turned around and started heading back. On the way back, I saw
a person smoking outside their house and asked them for directions to somewhere
I could eat. Turns out just to the left of the hotel was a small shop and they
had a cafe, so I headed back.  
They had a minimum $20 so I ordered a seafood platter and a coke.
It was fairly greasy, but I was too hungry to care.

The little hut's roof was leaking from everywhere, but I sat up against the
counter with the company of a cat and some terrible American reality TV show.

I spoke to a local who spent 18 years in Melbourne but is back home with his
family. He told me how it is possible to survive without jobs here because they
live off the land, but that said most people still need an income. He worked at
the airport doing luggage stuff. He also recommended trying the traditional BBQ
where they cook food underground.
