Today was my last day in this paradise island! I was reflecting on what an
amazing trip this has been and I am already thinking about the next time I can
come back here, maybe for a kite surfing trip! Before I leave this place, I
wanted to get one more Ika Mata, so before returning my scooter I rode down to
Bite Time, which is fairly famous around the island for having really good
seafood. While I was there, I bumped into Brynn, one of the KiteSUP founders and
ended up having lunch and trading stories with her.  
I love how small this place is, it feels like everyone knows everyone else and
even just after my short stay I felt a little bit like a local myself.

From here I did another last lap of Avarua and started making my way to return
my scooter. Along the way I stopped at a little bakery and bought some coconut
bread for later on (considering I wouldn't have transport).

I returned my scooter and people at the hire place gave me a lift back to the
hotel. After cleaning up the last of the my things, I saw Jack and Kim from The
Dive Center waiting by the pool for scuba lessons and I went out to have a
little chat with them while they waited.

I wanted to enjoy this peaceful, quiet bliss for a little longer before going
back to the stresses of reality soon enough, so I lounged around the pool for a
bit and had a little nap. I went into the office and had a chat with Jane and
thanked her for all the help during my stay. Both Jane and Rungi helped me with
tourist information, bookings and as with the other staff have been really
friendly.

I got talking with the new guests arriving at the hotel and they had multiple
families all staying here - they basically booked the whole hotel! I ended up
cooking up the remaining food (steak, potatos, tomatoes, cucumber, cheese,
beers, etc.) and had a BBQ with them. We finished up around 8:30 and by this
time it was too late to go to the shipwreck hut for a farewell drink as they
close at 9:00, so I just washed my dishes, cleaned up my last minute things,
had a shower and packed my suitcase - I even managed about half an hour sleep
before there was a knock at the door. The transfer guy arrived 20 minutes early,
but either way I loaded up the car, picked up another family along the way and
arrived at the airport pretty early!

The screen at the airport said the flight was delayed by an hour, but I only had
an hour to transfer at Auckland, so I thought I was going to have a hard time
but when I got to the counter, the screen had updated and it was running on
time.

After my bags were checked in, I got a toasty and a muffin from a small stall
nearby and went through security. It was a very simple process here, security is
basically one gate with basically no queue and then your in the departure
lounge!

I got to the gate and still had more than 2 hours to kill. The recommendation is
normally to get to the airport 3 hours early for international flights, but that
doesn't seem necessary here!

I sat there listening to music when I saw a familiar face, it was Sarah that I
had met in Muri beach the day of Captain Tama's Lagoon Cruise. We ended up
chatting the whole time and before we knew it the plane was boarding. This long
delay ended up disappearing so fast with the help of such great company. We said
our farewells and boarded the plane. The holiday was over but this trip has been
absolutely incredible and I can't wait to do it all again someday.

When I arrived home, it felt like I was slowly waking up to the much more fast
paced life here, it was like I was gone for a lot longer than I was, maybe
because this trip was specifically to relax instead of trying to get in lots of
tourist stuff. Even on the way back home, there was a construction sign that
said "Don't drive and Pokemon", I couldn't help but think how different the
beach lifestyle was. Having a holiday with a very small and loose agenda,
completely cut off from the internet, phones, TV, etc. and being forced to run
out of things to do has been so rewarding that I definitely plan on doing this
again sometime soon.
