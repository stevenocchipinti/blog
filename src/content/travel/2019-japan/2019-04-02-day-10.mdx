We woke up at 5:30am to get the 6:18am local train from Kinshicho to Narita airport. I wanted the easiet way to get to the airport and the staff and the Moxy suggested the local train that takes about 1.5 hours but doesn't require any transfers so we went with that option. It was also the cheapest option and was 1320Â¥ each. It was about 5 degrees when we got outside so when we got to the station we got some warm drinks from the vending machine to warm our hands. I got houjicha and Steve got hot chocolate. The train was comfortable as we got a seat and they are heated. We arrived at Narita, checked in and decided to get some last snacks; matcha latte, onigiri, choc chip melon pan, peach ice tea and chocolate macadamias. Now waiting for our flight to board.

Before we get on the plane Steve made use of the 10 min 200Â¥ massage chair in preparation for our 10 hour trip home ðŸ˜†.

This flight was better than the one up because it was basically empty! There were a lot of empty rows and even more food because it was during the day. Plenty of snacks and some very nice soba noodles. Another nice feature is the Japanese toilets, although that would have been on the flight up as well.
