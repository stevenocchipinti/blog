Breakfast is on the 11th floor and has a great view! The breakfast spread was pretty big too. We had a massive breakfast including croissants, omelettes, cold cuts, cheese, yoghurt, fruit and a few sweets. We went a little crazy but this huge meal will probably take us until dinner tonight in Spain.

We organised a late check out which means we can stay here until about 1:30 which is exactly when we need to leave for the airport, perfect!

After breakfast, I cut my hair, had a shower and freshened up for the trip. We caught a taxi at 1:30 to go to Naples airport. I've managed to lock the luggage bag ok but I don't trust it going through the budget airline baggage handling, if this zip gets ripped off somehow I won't have a way to lock it at all! So, as some insurance, I thought I'd try one of the bag wrapping services for the first time. This way the lock and the zips will be secured flat and can't get caught on anything. ðŸ¤ž

We arrived in Spain about 30mins later as our flight was delayed. We hopped into a cab and I showed them the air bnb address. When we arrived he dropped us at a tiny street and said he couldn't drive us in so we had to walk with our luggage. We couldn't find the number of the house and then asked someone. They told us this was the wrong area and our place was elsewhere. The taxi driver had dropped us in the wrong location! I messaged Rocio, our air bnb host and confirmed the location on google maps. Lucky it was only about 12 mins walk away and Steve navigated. The weather was still lovely and although it was 8:30pm it was completely bright. We finally found a lady waiting on a street who was there to meet us and take us to our apartment.

We finally arrived at our air bnb which was a very cute apartment. By this time we were ready to eat as it was 9pm. I messaged Rocio, our host who lives in UK, for recommendations and she told us to try a tapas bar called Perros ViejosÂ about 10mins walk away.

We headed over to the restaurant and when we arrived we asked to sit upstairs. It had a very cool feel, the service was great and again we ordered too much! We started with 4 tapas recommended dishes from the waiter and then a salad and beautiful crispy chicken dish. We had to try sangria too! Unfortunately we couldn't fit in their famous dessert which was fried brioche and tiramisu called torrija. It was a great welcome dinner to Spain and we timed it well as we were eating around 10pm which is more Spanish dinner time!

This area has a lot of monuments to check out and even on our fairly short walk home we did has a few, one of which was the Metropol Parasol that looked like a giant wooden structure, pretty cool at night too.
