Git v2.8 introduced a new configuration option called `user.useconfigonly`. This
option prevents git from trying to guess your email address to use for the
author metadata for a commit and forces you to have configured one.

This is great news because with a good workflow in place you can be sure you
always have the correct email addresses on your commits.

## Global Configuration

If `user.useconfigonly` is set to `true`, you will need to configure an email
address. The simplest way is with this command:

```
git config --global user.name 'Steve Occhipinti'
git config --global user.email steve@example.com
```

Which will result in a configuration like this saved in `~/.gitconfig`:

```
[user]
  name = Steve Occhipinti
  email = steve@example.com
```

This is great, but what if you want to work on personal projects and work
projects on the same machine?

## Per Repository Configuration

Instead of using the global config in the home directory, git will first look
for a local configuration in `./.git/config`. To set per repository
configuration, all you have to do is `cd` to the repo and run the same commands
but without the `--global` flag:

```
git config user.name 'Steve Occhipinti'
git config user.email steve@example.com
```

## Mixing Work And Personal

If you have a global configuration, all repositories will use that as a default
unless you remember to set a per-repository config. If you don't set a global
config, git will normally guess what your email is and use that if its valid.

If you set the `useconfigonly` option and remove your global config, git will
not allow you to make a commit until you've setup your user details and this
will prevent accidentally using your work email address on a personal project or
vice-versa.

However, I do leave my name configured globally as that is not going to change
between repositories.

## Visual Queues

Having that error appear when you haven't setup an email address is great, but
rather than waiting for me to make a mistake, I added an exclamation mark
indicator to my shell prompt to remind me to set up the user details.

The basic idea is something like this:

```bash
local noauthor
git config user.email > /dev/null || noauthor="!"
export $PS1="$noauthor${PS1}"
```

## Quicker Configuration

If this is something that I will have to do for every repo I create or clone, I
want to it be pain free. Git makes it really easy to create new sub commands
simply by putting a script named `git-xxxx` in the path, where `xxxx` is the
sub command name.

I created a `git-author` script like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

email_list_file="$HOME/.config/git/author-emails"
has_pecorb=$(type pecorb > /dev/null 2>&1)

echo "Current author: $(git config user.name) <$(git config user.email)>"

if [ -f $email_list_file ] && $has_pecorb; then
  email=$(pecorb $email_list_file)
else
  echo -n "Enter a new email address: "
  read email
fi

git config user.email $email
```

Now when go to a repo and I see my `!` indicator, all I have to do is run `git
author`.

This allows me to put all my email addresses in a file and then select the one I
want from a nice menu. Note, I'm using `pecorb` here which is a
[gem I wrote](https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/pecorb) to generate selectable
menus on the command line, but there are plenty of
[alternatives](https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/pecorb#kudos) or you could
just use `read` in `bash` and type it in (which my script falls back to).

## My Bash Prompt

The prompt I use may not be the tidiest, but its available
[here](https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/homesync/blob/1a345e563afb47b81d405d47e4a6b45b63e82c98/data/.bash_git).
