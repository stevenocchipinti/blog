Not the most creative name for your average blog, but for those that dont know:

> _“the transfer of a large quantity of information from one person to another or to a piece of paper can be referred to as a ‘brain dump’.”_
> -- Wikipedia

I created this blog mainly as a place to keep a record of things I’m likely to forget, such as cool command line tricks, handy websites, etc.  
Nothing very important, just random thoughts really.
