Have you ever SSH’ed to a server and found you need to copy some data back where
a simple selection copy and paste just doesn’t seem practical? When this
happens to me, I normally dump that data to a temp file, start up another
terminal and SCP the file back before going back to delete the temp file, but I
recently found a better way.

I discovered `xclip`. Using the `-X` option of SSH to enable X11 forwarding,
`xclip` allows you to interact with the _“X selections”_ clipboard.

To use it, log on to a remote server via ssh `-X` and ensure `xclip` is
installed, then simply pipe data to `xclip` and you will be able to paste it
anywhere locally with the usual X selection paste (mouse wheel click,
shift-insert, etc.).

Here is an example:

```
ssh -X steve@example.com
sudo apt-get install xclip
ps -ef | xclip
```

Now anywhere on your local linux machine, you can press `<shift>` `<insert>` (or
mouse wheel click) to paste the content. If you need to pipe this data to
another process locally, you can retrieve the clipboard from the command like
with `xclip` like this:

```
xclip -o | less
```
