Just a quick note, these days most cameras automatically geotag photos which is
pretty cool, especially when taking travel photos, but sometimes you may not
want everyone to know where a photo was actually taken. For example, a photo of
your backyard could give away your home address which is probably not a great
thing.

Its really easy to clear the geotag data with a great little tool called
`exiftool`. I used this tool in an [earlier blog
post](https://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/04/24-70mm-f28-vs-17-50mm-f28.html)
too and I find it really useful!

To install `exiftool` in Ubuntu:

```
$> sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl
```

Then executing `exiftool` followed by a jpg filename will output a whole bunch
of exif data for you - some of which may have geolocation data:

```
$> exiftool image.jpg
ExifTool Version Number         : 8.60
File Name                       : image.jpg
Directory                       : .
File Size                       : 14 kB
…
```

The clear this geotag data out, simply issue this command:

```
$> exiftool -gps:all= image.jpg
```
