I've been using Raspbmc for a while now, but I only just saw that it has been
superseded by [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/) (and XBMC is now called [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/),
so with the long weekend I thought I'd upgrade.

The upgrade process is really simple. I backed up my existing installtion of
Raspbmc, downloaded the offical [OSMC installer](https://osmc.tv/download/)
from their site, installed it over the top and booted it up.

From here, there are only a few things to do. I entered my [MPG2 and WVC1 codecs](https://osmc.tv/help/wiki/pi-buycodec),
setup my video sources and kicked off the scrapers and installed a few addons.
The only other thing is setting up my TV remote.
(I did this last time but forgot how, so this time I thought I'd blog it!)

Out of the box, my Samsung _"Smart Touch"_ Remote ([this one](http://reviews.lcdtvbuyingguide.com/samsung-lcd-tv/pictures/samsung-f6400-remote.jpg)
if you're wondering) mostly just works, the only problem is the back button
opens the context menu instead of going back!

To fix this, the first step is to find out what each button on the remote maps
to in Kodi. Thanks to this great [forum post](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=139145&pid=1285390#pid1285390)
by a user called "Knapster" this is really easy.

Just SSH to the pi, create a new file `~/.kodi/userdata/keymaps/remote.xml` and
paste [this contents](https://gist.github.com/stevenocchipinti/42f2eca2a9f04ed9e52f)
in it. Now reboot Kodi and everytime you press a button, you'll get a
notification on the screen of what command it is sending.

A quick way of doing that from an SSH session is like this:  
(The default username and password are both `osmc`)

```
ssh osmc@<kodi-ip-address>
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stevenocchipinti/42f2eca2a9f04ed9e52f/raw/remote.xml > ~/.kodi/userdata/keymaps/remote.xml
sudo reboot
```

In my case, everything seemed to make sense except the back button, which was
actually sending `title` instead of `back`. As I don't have a _title_ button,
I'm going to reassign that to be a back button instead.

First, lets replace our `remote.xml` with the default configuration, you can get
these mappings from the installed Kodi files:

```
cp /usr/share/kodi/system/keymaps/remote.xml ~/.kodi/userdata/keymaps/remote.xml
```

This file has what every command does in every context and makes it easy to
modify. Here is a diff of the changes I made for my remote:

```
58c58
<       <title>ContextMenu</title>
---
>       <title>Back</title>
74c74
<       <guide>ActivateWindow(TVGuide)</guide>
---
>       <guide>ActivateWindow(Home)</guide>
79c79
<       <red>ActivateWindow(TVChannels)</red>
---
>       <red>ContextMenu</red>
```

I've made the _"title"_ button send the `back` command and because I don't have
a TV tuner connected, I've also re-assigned the _"TV Guide"_ button to go to the
home screen and the _"Red"_ button to be the context menu button.  
Interestingly, the channel up and down buttons on my remote we already assigned
to page up and page down, which suits me great while I don't have a TV Tuner.

After rebooting, I now have a functional remote control!
