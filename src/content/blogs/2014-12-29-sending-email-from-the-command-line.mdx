It's so easy to write little scripts and execute them at a later time with
the standard command-line tooling available in unix-like operating systems, but
if you plan on having them execute while you are out and about, it would be nice
to get a notification on your phone that it worked (or didn't work).

If you're happy with a simple email notification, then luckily this can be done
with one simple line of code!

On a mac:

```sh
echo "Hello" | mail -s "Your alert" to-addr@example.com -f from-addr@example.com
```

On \*nix:

```sh
echo "Hello" | mail -s "Your alert" to-addr@example.com -aFrom:from-addr@example.com
```
