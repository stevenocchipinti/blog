## The Machine

My gaming computer runs Microsoft Windows 10 and has the following hardware:

**Case:** Corsair Carbide Air 240  
**CPU:** Intel Core i5 4690  
**Motherboard:** ASUS Z97M-PLUS  
**RAM:** Corsair Vengence Pro 1600C9R (2x4GB)  
**GPU:** Sapphire R9 280X Dual-X OC 3GB  
**PSU:** Silverstone Strider Gold 750w ST75F-GS  
**SSD:** Corsair Force LS 120GB  
**Cooler:** Corsair H100i  
**Fans:** Corsair AIR SP120 Twin Pack

## The Problem

Sometimes my computer would turn it self on at some random time. It
wasn't at a particular repeatable time, but just every now and then.

## What I Tried

- Disabling the _Fast Boot_ app
- Uninstalling the _Fast Boot_ app
- Experimenting with various BIOS settings
- Disabling _boot from network_ (from BIOS boot priorities)
- Power options -> power-plan -> advanced -> PCIe -> link state power management
- (... and a few more that I can't remember)

But after all that, it would still turn on every couple of days.

## The Solution

Eventually I found and disabled _Windows Fast Start_:

- Power options -> system (choose buttons) -> fast startup

This turned out to be the culprit and now my computer and I can both stop
working through the night!
