Today marks 1 year since my first blog post. In that time I have written 40
posts and this site has received over 7000 views from all over the world! I’ve
had some great feedback (even from total strangers), which has been fantastic -
It’s a good feeling to know that my ramblings can actually be useful for others
too.

I started this blog because as a fairly technical person, I am constantly
learning, but one of the caveats of this constant learning culture is that some
people (such as myself) find it quite hard to remember all the cool stuff we
pick up over the years, so this blog’s primary purpose was to act as a ”_memory
supplement_”.

The idea being that when you read something new, it will only stay in your head
if you keep using it (or, unlike me, if you have a really good memory), but
sometimes what ever it is that we just learned won’t be totally relevant or
useful until much later.

One of the best ways that I have found to retain this knowledge is to use it!
For example, if you are reading up on a new programming language, use it! Write
little scripts, re-write other existing programs in this new language and just
get used to using it regularly. If this isn’t available (or suitable) I find
talking about it with other like-minded people will reinforce the knowledge too.
Alot of the time, you can really reinforce your knowledge of a topic by teaching
it to someone else. Meetups and groups of like minded friends are great for
this.

This is part of the reason I started this blog. Once I learn something new (that
I have a desire to remember) I try to write up a quick blog post as soon as I
can. Not only does this reinforce my knowledge, but if I do happen to forget,
instead of using Google to re-learn it, I can simply use my blog’s search to
find my own post on the topic and has the convenience of being written in my own
way of thinking/writing. Even if my post is out-of-date, or not complete
enough, it will still refresh my memory and give me a better foundation to start
learning up on that particular topic once again.

This blog has served its purpose well and will continue to do so. If you have a
similar way of thinking (or a similar memory) as me, I highly recommend starting
a blog!

Thanks to everyone that has been reading so far! :-)
