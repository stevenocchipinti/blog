So it turns out bash has a vi mode! (Can’t believe I didn’t know about this
earlier)

To enable vi mode, just type this into your shell:

```
$> set -o vi
```

That will enable it for this shell so you can try it out, and if you like it,
add that line to your ~/.bashrc file for future.

One really useful vi-mode command is pressing ’v’ from command mode. This will
put your current command line into vim to modify.

To get more help on the commands available in vi-mode, take a look at the bottom
of this man page:

```
$> man 3 readline
```

To get more information on the various options available for bash, take a look
at:

```
$> help set
```

I’m going to give it ago in the coming weeks to see if its actually useful or
not.

So far, I’ve found one small annoyance, I use ctrl+l to clear the terminal, but
with the vi key bindings enabled, this only works from command mode (you have to
hit ESC first). To fix this, I added this to my ~/.bashrc file:

```
bind -m vi-insert ‘Control-l: clear-screen’
```

These commands could also be added to `/etc/inputrc`, but I’m happy to leave these
2 lines together in my `~/.bashrc` so its easier to remember.
