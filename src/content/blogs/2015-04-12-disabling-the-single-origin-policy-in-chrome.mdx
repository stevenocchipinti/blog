If you ever needed to circumvent the browsers
[Same Origin Policy (SOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)
so you don't need to add
[Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
headers just to test out an idea, here is a quick little hack to open a new
instance of Chrome that will not enforce these security features:

```
alias unsafe-chrome='/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --user-data-dir=~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/UnsafeChrome --disable-web-security 2> /dev/null'
```

The important options here are:

`--disable-web-security` - This will disable the Same Origin Policy  
`--user-data-dir=...` - This launches a separate instance, with its own user data
directory.  
This prevents you from needing to close any current instances of chrome,
otherwise running this command will just bring the existing instance into focus.

Another good thing about giving this instance its own `user-data-dir` is that
you can give this instance its own settings. For example, this instance is not
signed into my Google account and I've configured a bright red theme so I can
easily tell the difference between my normal Chrome and my insecure Chrome!
