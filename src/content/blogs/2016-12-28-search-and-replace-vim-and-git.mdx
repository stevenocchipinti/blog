Git provides some nice utility functionality that can make a vim development
environment much nicer. With recent updates to Vim it can now execute a command
for every item in the quickfix list (`:cdo`) and location list (`:ldo`). These
features work together quite nicely.

This new functionality has been introduced to vim from version 7.4.858 and is
therefore available in vim8 and also available in neovim.

## The Old Way

Back in 2011 I wrote a
[post about doing search and replace across multiple files](http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/05/search-and-replace-in-multiple-files.html/)
with just the basic vim functionality. It's quite common to use the arg list
because its easy to add to:

```vim
:arg *.js
:arg `git ls-files`
```

and it's easy to execute commands:

```vim
:argdo %s/foo/bar/gc
```

## The New Way

Now that we can execute a command from the quickfix and location lists it is
much easier to make larger, more controlled edits with the help of other
features or plugins.

If you use `syntastic` or `neomake` for linting, a compiler via the `:make`
command, the built in `:grep` or `:vimgrep` commands or any number of other
plugins that integrate with these lists, such as
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive), you can take advantage of
`:cdo` and `:ldo`.

```vim
:grep foo **/*.js
```

Then you can execute commands like this:

```vim
:cdo s/foo/bar/gc
```

## Git Is Awesome

Git is incredibly powerful and I often use a couple of features that are often
overlooked:

- `git ls-files` - recursively list all the files in the repo
- `git grep` - grep through all the files in the repo

One of the reasons these commands are so good is because by default they will
ignore the items in the `.gitignore` file.

I tend to work with javascript a fair bit and having an easy way to avoid those
nasty `node_modules` directories readily available is great! Best of all, these
tools are available on just about every machine I work, on including the
machines of other peoples that I pair with.

## My Workflow

I use `ctrl-p` in vim and rather than relying on yet another third party tool
like `ack` or `ag`, I've configured `crtl-p` like this:

```vim
let g:ctrlp_user_command = [
\  '.git',
\  'cd %s && git ls-files . -co --exclude-standard',
\  'find %s -type f'
\]
```

It is super fast and I haven't come across a situation where I need ctrl-p for a
large enough non-git repo and `find` wasn't good enough for... yet!

If you use [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive), there is also
a `:Ggrep` command that behaves much like the builtin `:grep` command, but it
will ignore the `.gitignore` items. I use this quite a lot too:

```vim
:Ggrep foo
:Ggrep foo **/*.js
```

Then you can execute commands in the same manner as above:

```vim
:cdo s/foo/bar/gc
```

Because I use this so often, I've added the following mapping to my config to
automatically search for the token under my cursor:

```
map <leader>g :Ggrep!  <Bar> copen
```
