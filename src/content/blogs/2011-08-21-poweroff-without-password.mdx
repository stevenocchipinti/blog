Ever find it strange that in Ubuntu you can use the GUI to shutdown the computer
without a password, but if you use the poweroff command you will need to type in
a password?

Well there is an easy fix. The `/etc/sudoers` file governs the use of the sudo
command. It can also be configured to allow specified commands, users and/or
groups to not have to worry about a sudo password.

In Ubuntu, this file also sources the `/etc/sudoers.d/` directory so the sudoers
file doesnâ€™t get too cluttered.

I created a new file called `powercmds` under this directory with the following
contents:

```
# Allow users in the admin group to poweroff the machine without a password
%admin ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/poweroff, /sbin/halt, /sbin/reboot
```

Then updated its permissions with this command:

```
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/powercmds
```

Now anyone in the admin group will not require a password to shutdown the
machine.

This is very useful for scripting, such as if I want to download a large file
and have the computer shutdown when its finished (so I can go to bed or
something) this is now possible:

```
wget http://somesite.com/somefile.big 2> ~/Desktop/dl.log; sudo poweroff
```
