If you use ssh on a regular basis, you probably already know about setting up
ssk-keys. If you dont know about ssh-keys, you should! - its worth reading up
on.

`ssh-copy-id` is a helper script that will copy your public key across to the
remote machine and append it to the authorized_keys file.

This is all well and good if the server is on port 22, but for non-standard
ports, this script does not support a \-p option.

Instead of copying across the key manually, I googled for workarounds and came
across [this
post](https://mikegerwitz.com/2009/10/07/ssh-copy-id-and-sshd-port/) where the
author explains that the arguments to `ssh-copy-id` are simply passed on to the
ssh command.

This means by using quotes, everything inside of them will be passed straight
through and that allows a command like this to achieve the desired result:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub '-p xxxx username@host'
```

Kudos to Mike Gerwitz for the tip.
