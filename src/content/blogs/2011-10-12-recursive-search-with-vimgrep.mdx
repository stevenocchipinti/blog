Usually when I need to find things in multiple files, I would use `grep` or
`ack` from a terminal and then open those files in vim to do whatever it is that
I have to do.

This is ok, but sometimes this can be a little annoying.  
Vim has a `:grep` function which will use the system `grep` command, but it also has
a `:vimgrep` function that is built in to vim.

I had left a bunch of `TODO`s through out my code as a reminder to come back to
them, so using `:vimgrep` I was able to quickly jump between them:

```
:vimgrep TODO **/*
```

This tells vim to search for the pattern `TODO` recursively from the current
directory.  
The `**/` means recursive and the `*` means any file - therefore `**/*.rb`
would just search the ruby scripts.

The results are loaded into the "quickfix window". This means if you want to see
all the occurences, you can open the list with `:copen` Naturally, `:cnext`,
`:cprevious`, `:cfirst`, `:clast`, etc. will allow you to jump between them or
you can use the quicklist window and press enter on the filename, or in gvim you
can even use the mouse.

In addition, I use [Tim Popeâ€™s Unimpaired vim
plugin](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired), which provides the easy
shortcuts `[q` and `]q` for `:cprevious` and `:cnext` (respectively).
