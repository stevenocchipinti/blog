title: "Rake task with an arbitrary number of arguments"

Rake gives you a way of specifying arguments for a given task like this:

```ruby
desc "A task that can accept a optional 'foo' argument"
task :thing, [:foo] do |task, args|
  puts args[:foo]
end
```

This will make the value of `foo` available in the `args` variable.
When you run `rake -T`, it will show you that argument like this:

```bash
$> rake -T
rake thing[foo]  # A task that can accept a optional 'foo' argument
```

But what if you want to allow an arbitrary number of arguments, like a list of
usernames to report on?

## A solution

You could use an alternative method of passing arguments in, such as `ARGV` or
Environment Variables, but Rake does provide a way.
The `args` block parameter behaves like a hash, but it is actually a
`Rake::TaskArguments` object. This object responds to an `#extras` method that
will return an array of any extra arguments.

For example:

```ruby
task :thing, [:foo] do |task, args|
  puts args[:foo]     # First argument
  puts args.extras    # The rest of the arguments
end
```

This will allow you to call the task like this:

```bash
$> rake thing[foo]
foo

$> rake thing[foo,extra1,extra2]
foo
extra1
extra2
```

## Caveats

While you can specify many arguments on the command line, (unless they are
quoted) the arguments can not be separated by spaces, for example:

```bash
$> rake thing[foo,extra1]    # GOOD
foo
extra1
$> rake thing[foo, extra1]   # BAD
Don't know how to build task 'thing[foo,'
```

This means you may want to include some explanation in the `desc` section.

Also, `rake -T` will not show the "extra" arguments, only the named arguments:

```bash
$> rake -T
rake thing[foo]  # A task that can accept a optional 'foo' argument
```
