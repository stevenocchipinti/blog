By default, the indicator applet in the Unity panel has an item in the list for evolution and another for empathy - two programs I donâ€™t use!

But, its quite easy to get rid of them! All you have to do is remove the appropriate file in /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications

Instead of removing them, I just removed all read permissions (root can still do anything with it of course)

```
$ cd /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications
$ sudo chmod 000 empathy evolution
```
