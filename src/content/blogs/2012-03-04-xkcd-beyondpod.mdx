On my Android phone, I use an app called
"[BeyondPod](https://market.android.com/details?id=mobi.beyondpod&hl=en%20)".

BeyondPod is great because unlike [Google
Reader](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.reader&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLnJlYWRlciJd)
and
[Pulse](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.alphonso.pulse&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5hbHBob25zby5wdWxzZSJd)
(which are other great RSS readers), BeyondPod will download video and audio
podcasts on a schedule.

What this means for me, is that at 2:30 AM, my phone will use my home ADSL2’s
off-peak downloads and fetch a bunch of regular podcasts so when I wake up and
make my way into work, I will have all the latest episodes of my favourite shows
to watch and listen to on the train.

One of the feeds that I’m subscribed to is [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/%20). If you
look at the comics online, you probably already know that if hover your mouse
over the image, you get to see an extra message about the comic.

On Google Reader, you can tap and hold the image and use the menu to get to the
tooltip, but with BeyondPod, there is no such option.

This means that the tooltip is actually included in the
[feed](http://xkcd.com/atom.xml), so I thought it would be pretty easy to write
a little proxy that pulls out the `title=` attribute and appends it to the body.

Before I started coding, I thought that surely someone would have already done
this, so after a quick Google search I came across a [Yahoo!
Pipe](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=upJ5TUni3BGUZU9yLO2fWQ) from
"[Benjamin
Cook](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/person.info?guid=D4HQ7VIJ2YNE6NZRH3VHJOBREA)"
that does exactly that.

Ben’s Pipe appends a `<br />` and then the tooltip, but the `<br />` seems to be
getting escaped, so I copied the pipe and removed the `<br />` and the end
result was exactly what I wanted.

If you have a similar problem, you can add [my version of the
pipe](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=61e54ab0572541bd03cd44f3e601482e)
to your reader and here’s what it’ll look like:
