I have a fairly terrible memory but I've found writing and referring back to
cheatsheets to be a pretty effective way to memorize things.

I ended up referring back to my previous
[cheatsheet on `git reset`](http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2015/03/24/git-reset-cheatsheet/)
quite a few times soon after I wrote it, so when I came across
[this great post on regex features in ruby](http://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/11-regular-extremism.html)
I thought I'd share the lookarounds section because I _always_ forget those too!

| Syntax   | Description         | Example                | Result |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| `(?=X)`  | Positive lookahead  | `"Ruby"[/.(?=b)/]`     | `"u"`  |
| `(?!X)`  | Negative lookahead  | `"Ruby"[/.(?!u)/]`     | `"u"`  |
| `(?<=X)` | Positive lookbehind | `"Ruby"[/(?<=u)./]`    | `"b"`  |
| `(?<!X)` | Negative lookbehind | `"Ruby"[/(?<!R\|^)./]` | `"b"`  |
