I finally decided to install Minecraft on my new shiny [Toshiba Portege z830](https://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html).  
Ubuntu ships with an open-source version of Java, which did run Minecraft, but the graphics were terrible, even on the lowest settings. There were artefacts everywhere!

So as recommended, I switched to the official JRE. Now the login screen works, but that's about it. After logging in, I just got a black screen and the following exception in the console:

```

```

After discussing the problem in IRC, the solution was quite simple. It turns out `lwjgl` is a "_Light Weight Java Game Library_" and the version I had wasn't behaving.  
On the advice of the helpful IRC'ers, I downloaded the latest `lwjgl` from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/) (which at time of writing is 2.8.3) to get it all to work nicely.

To install it, I downloaded the zip file, extracted it to a temporary directory, then copied across these files:

```
cp lwjgl-2.8.3/jar/lwjgl.jar ~/.minecraft/bin
cp lwjgl-2.8.3/native/linux/* ~/.minecraft/bin/natives
```

Done! Now it works nicely.
