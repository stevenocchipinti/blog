The `reset` command in git does quite a lot, but I always forget all its uses.  
This is a cheatsheet based on [this blog](http://git-scm.com/blog/2011/07/11/reset.html).

The `reset` command will:

1. Move whatever branch `HEAD` points to _(stop here unless `--soft`)_
2. THEN, make the Index look like that _(stop here unless `--hard`)_
3. THEN, make the Working Directory look like that

## Commit level

|                            | Updates Current Branch? | Updates Index? | Updates Working Dir? | Working Dir Safe?                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `reset --soft [commit]`    | YES                     | NO             | NO                   | YES                                             |
| `reset (--mixed) [commit]` | YES                     | YES            | NO                   | YES                                             |
| `reset --hard [commit]`    | YES                     | YES            | YES                  | <span style="color: rgb(255, 38, 0);">NO</span> |
| `checkout [commit]`        | NO                      | YES            | YES                  | YES                                             |

**reset &#45;&#45;soft [commit]**  
When given `HEAD~`, this undos the git commit  
Will move the current branch back to the given commit, but not update the index or working directory  
This provides similar functionality as `git checkout --amend` (but changing the whole commit, not just the message)

**reset (&#45;&#45;mixed) [commit] <span style="color: rgb(160, 160, 160); font-weight: normal;">(default form)</span>**  
When given `HEAD~`, this undos the `git commit` and the `git add`  
Will move the current branch and update the index, but working directory will remain untouched

**reset &#45;&#45;hard [commit] <span style="color: rgb(255, 38, 0);">(unsafe)</span>**  
When given `HEAD~`, this undos the `git commit`, `git add` and also the changes in the working directory  
Will update all three trees to match the given commit  
This is useful to remove commits you donâ€™t want  
From a clean working tree, it is also useful to undo a conflicted (or not conflicted) `git merge` or a `git pull`  
From a dirty working tree, use `--merge` instead, this will safely preserve your local changes  
The `--keep` option is useful when removing some of the last commits while safely keeping your local changes

**checkout [commit]**  
When given `HEAD~`, this will safely update the working directory and the index without moving the current branch  
This will leave you in a _detached HEAD_ state

## File level

|                            | Updates Current Branch? | Updates Index? | Updates Working Dir? | Working Dir safe?                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `reset (commit) [file]`    | NO                      | YES            | NO                   | YES                                             |
| `checkout (commit) [file]` | NO                      | NO             | YES                  | <span style="color: rgb(255, 38, 0);">NO</span> |

**reset (commit) [file]**  
When given a file path, the first step of updating the branch that `HEAD` points to is skipped  
Will update the index only to match commit, leaving both working directory and current branch untouched  
From here, you could use `git checkout` to make the working directory match the index, although `git checkout` can do that with one command (see below)  
The commit parameter will default to `HEAD` which effectively _un-stages_ files

**checkout (commit) [file] <span style="color: rgb(255, 38, 0);">(unsafe)</span>**  
Updates the working directory only, without changing the index, current branch or even what `HEAD` is pointing to  
This would effectively be `git reset --hard [branch] file`, but this command does not exist
