In ruby, the `||=` operator will assign a given value to a variable, if that
variable does not already have a value.
For example:

```ruby default_value.rb
puts foo  # => nil
foo ||= "bar"
puts foo  # => "bar"
foo ||= "baz"
puts foo  # => "bar"
```

This will assign `"bar"` to `foo`, unless `foo` is already set.
In other words, it will make `"bar"` the _default value_ of `foo`.

I recently had to do this is bash, and it turns out bash has similar
functionality. This is the bash equivalent:

```bash default_value.sh
echo $FOO  # => ""
export FOO=${FOO:-"bar"}
echo $FOO  # => "bar"
export FOO=${FOO:-"baz"}
echo $FOO  # => "bar"
```
