As mentioned in a [previous
post](https://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/09/code-review-workflow-with-github.html),
we use [GitHub-Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) at work
and I really like it. In essence, it involves doing work in feature branches,
while maintaining an _always deployable_ `master` branch, then opening a pull
request to merge a new feature / bugfix into `master`, which provides a great
mechanism for code review / sign-off.

So a fairly typical situation would be as follows:

- Bug found in app
- Create an issue on GitHub with description, assignee, etc.
- Create a new branch off `master` for the fix
- Code it up, test locally, etc.
- Push branch to GitHub
- Open pull request to merge back into `master`
- Get review / sign-off inside of the pull request
- Deploy

When a pull request is opened on GitHub, it automatically creates an issue for
that pull request, which would normally be helpful, but we already created an
issue when the bug was discovered. So now we have 2 issues and 1 pull request.
What’s nice is that if I push more commits to that branch, it will appear in the
pull request automatically, but not the initial issue.

After looking into this, it seems (AFAIK) GitHub do not provide a way of
attaching a pull request to an existing issue via the site, but they do provide
that functionality via their API.

That is when I discovered [Hub](http://defunkt.io/hub/), which is a wrapper for
git and while it adds more power to alot of the standard git commands, hub adds
one command that is really useful for me:

```
git pull-request -i 49
```

This basically means _"Open a pull request to merge the current branch into
`master` and attach the pull request to issue 49"_.

This means that the initial bug description, the commits, the review
conversation and the merge are all encapsulated in a single issue - fantastic!  
I don’t know why this isn’t built in to the web interface (or maybe it is and I
just don’t know how).
