There are a ton of extended auto-completions that come with Ubuntu, but they are disabled by default.

Have a look in the `/etc/bash_completion.d/` directory for the programs that have specific auto-completes (such as `apt-get`, `git`, `apache2ctl`, etc.).

To get all the extra auto-completion-goodness, all you have to do is source `/etc/bash_completion` in your profile.

I added this is my `.bashrc`, but there may already be a commented out block for this in the stock .bashrc file for ubuntu:

```
# Enable bash completion in interactive shells
if \[ -f /etc/bash_completion \] && ! shopt -oq posix; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
fi
```
