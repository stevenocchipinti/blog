Following on from a previous post about [rewriting indentation for an entire git repo](http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2015/04/30/rewriting-indentation-in-every-file-and-every-commit/),
another reason to rewrite the history of a whole repo is to change the email
address or name mentioned in commits.

Once again, be aware that rewriting history will cause problems if other people
have clones of the repo so make sure you understand the risks before doing
this!

To change the author name and email address for every commit, you can run this:

```bash
git filter-branch -f --env-filter "
  GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='YOUR_NAME'
  GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='YOUR_EMAIL'
  GIT_COMMITTER_NAME='YOUR_NAME'
  GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL='YOUR_EMAIL'
" HEAD
```

This will blindly replace all the commits with the details given, but if other
people have contributed, you may need to be a bit more careful and only replace
your own:

```bash
git filter-branch --commit-filter "
  if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_NAME" = 'YOUR_ORIGINAL_NAME'];
  then
    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='YOUR_NEW_NAME'
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='YOUR_NEW_EMAIL'
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME='YOUR_NEW_NAME'
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL='YOUR_NEW_EMAIL'
    git commit-tree "$@";
  else
    git commit-tree "$@";
  fi
" HEAD
```

If you understand the risks of rewriting history for a shared repository, you
can force push with the `-f` flag:

```
git push -f
```

Then, to ensure future commits don't use the wrong name and email, you can set
it explicity for this particular repo (instead of globally) with these
commands:

```
git config user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Keep in mind this will only work for this particular clone as the details will
be stored locally in `.git/config`.
