Gone are the days of the nice `/boot/grub/menu.lst` file, but with new tools comes
new features.

## Changing the default boot item

In Grub2 you can change the default boot entry by editing the
`/etc/default/grub` file.  
In this file you’ll see something like this near the top:

```
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true
GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
```

The first line above tells Grub to boot the first boot entry by default (menu
item with index `0`).

You can simply change this to menu entry you prefer, but whenever you make any
change to this file you need to run the following command to make the changes
take effect:

```
$> sudo update-grub
```

## Changing the default boot entry from the command line

A new feature that Grub2 provides is to change this option dynamically from the
command-line.

In order for this to work, instead of setting the `GRUB_DEFAULT` option to the
desired index, set it to `saved` instead, like this:

```
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
```

And run `update-grub` to make the changes take effect:

Now you can use the `grub-set-default` and the `grub-reboot` commands.

Both commands take the index of the boot entry you want as a command line
argument:

```
$> grub-set-default <entry>
```

This command will permanently set the default boot entry to the index specified
on the command line, useful if you tend to change the default regularly.

```
$> grub-reboot <entry>
```

This command will reboot the machine and boot into the specified boot entry, but
only that once. The following boot will use the default.
