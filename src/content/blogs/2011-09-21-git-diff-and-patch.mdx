I recently found myself in a situation where I need to comment out certain lines
in my code in order to test a particular set of features.

These commented out lines are only for my local development environment but will
be useful in the future if this set of features needs work again. In this
situation, checking them into Git or making a personal `.gitignore` file are not
really suitable solutions.

I have found two good ways of accomplishing this.

## Git stash

Starting from a clean checkout, I put my temporary changes in place, then run
this command:

```
git stash
```

Then I continue on with my work. I selectively leave these changes out of all my
commits using `git add -i` then once everything is checked in except my
temporary changes, I revert these temporary changes with `git checkout -- .` so
I'm left with a clean repository.

When I need to work on a related feature again, I can list my stashes with:

```
git stash list
```

Then, apply the most recent stash by running this command:

```
git stash apply
```

If you have more than one stash, you can specify which stash you want to apply
on the command line. See `git stash --help` to see more information.

## Git diff and patch:

`diff` and `patch` are very useful tools to be familiar with if you ever deal
with text. Git's `diff` output is much the same, and so the `patch` tool is
still very handy!

Starting from a clean checkout, I put my temporary changes in place, then run
this command:

```
git diff > ~/patches/temp_workaround.patch
```

Then I continue on with my work. I selectively leave these changes out of all my
commits using `git add -i` then once everything is checked in except my
temporary changes, I revert these temporary changes with `git checkout -- .` so
I'm left with a clean repository.

When I need to work on a related feature again, I can apply my patch by running
this command from the project root:

```
patch -p1 < ~/patches/temp_workaround.patch
```

Both of these methods will put my temporary work arounds in place again which
saves me trying to work out which lines I needed to comment out everytime.
Saving the stashes and/or patch files with descriptive names means you can find
and re-use these temporary changes quite easily in the future.
