It seems the JavaScript community is divided into two camps when it comes to
indentation conventions: two spaces or four?

I personally prefer two spaces mainly because its what I'm used to in Ruby, I
find it easier on the eyes and just that little bit easier to keep my lines
under 80 characters long (yes, I still think this is good practice).

Our team had come to a general consensus for using two spaces, but when we were
starting a new project based on an existing project that used four spaces, we
thought it would be nice to fix all the whitespace in one go.

In a rush, we made a commit that literally replaced all the whitespace with the
following command:

```bash
find . -type f -exec sed -i "" "s/    /  /g" {} \;
```

The problem with this approach is that it makes going through commit messages
harder. It means that when you use `git annotate`, every line with indentation
is going to have the whitespace fix as the last commit, so then you would have
to jump back another commit to get the actual commit message for that line,
which can be fairly annoying.

Luckily, if you are forking an existing repository for a new project you have
the luxury of being able to rewrite history without causing any pain to others
as no one else would have checked it out yet.

Git provides a powerful command called `filter-branch`. It is designed to
rewrite large amounts of history in one go. This can be useful to purge
sensitive information from every commit or update an email address in the
commit data, etc. The only problem with this is, just like rebasing, any
existing checkouts will not be able to simply use `git pull` cleanly after the
history has been rewritten upstream, but this isn't a problem for new projects.

In order to execute the command above for every commit in our repo, we can make
use of the `--tree-filter` option like this:

```bash
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'find . -type f -exec sed -i "" "s/    /  /g" {} \;' HEAD
```

Please note, this can take quite some time, especially for large repositories.
You should also make sure there are no files that specifically need four spaces
(like markdown files, etc.), otherwise you may want to restrict the `find`
command to only effect files you know are safe to change (`*.js` for example).
