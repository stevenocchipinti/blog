title: "Bluetooth audio streaming from phone to Ubuntu"

I was toying with the idea of making my own "Car Computer" and one of the
crucial parts is a Bluetooth connection, but not for P2P file transfer (although
that could be useful), I would want this computer to appear the same way a
Bluetooth stereo or headset does, so once connected it will stream the audio
from my phone through the car speakers. Turns out it's quite easy with Ubuntu :)

PulseAudio is pretty awesome!  
First step is ensure Pulse has the Bluetooth module loaded (mine did by
default), you can check this by looking at this file `/etc/pulse/default.pa`

The next step is to configure the Bluetooth daemon to enable `Source` (and/or
`Gateway` mode).  
To do this, I added the following line to `/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf`:

```bash
Enable=Gateway,Source,Socket
```

Then restart the Bluetooth daemon:

```
$> sudo service bluetooth restart
```

Now you'll have to pair the computer with the phone as per normal. Once the
devices are paired, an `Audio Source` connection needs to be created. For this,
the easiest way is via DBus, but so we don't have to write a script, an easy way
to test this in an ad-hoc manner is to use a tool called `d-feet`, which is
available in the Ubuntu repos.

```
$> sudo apt-get install d-feet
```

Using `d-feet`, navigate to the `system bus` and find the `org.bluez` key. In
here, there will be another key that has a device number in it. (for me this
was `/org/bluez/1002/hci0/dev_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx`) Under this key, execute
`org.bluez.AudioSource > methods > Connect()` without any parameters and your
phone should now indicate that it is connected to the computer as an audio
device.

At this point, I started playing some music so I could tell when it was working, but you probably won't be able to hear anything just yet.  
That is because Pulse does not automatically send every source to every output - that could get messy!  
To configure pulse to send the audio from the Bluetooth connection to your speakers you need to determine the name of the audio source and the name of the "_sink_" (or output) and join them together.  
You can do this with the PulseAudio shell like this:

```
$> pacmd
>>> list-sources
>>> list-sinks
>>> load-module module-loopback source=bluez_source.xxxx sink=alsa_output.pci-xxxx
```

(Replace the `source=` and `sink=` parts with the names from the preceding two
commands)

Now all audio from your phone should be streaming through your computer. DBus
makes it really simple to do this programmatically, so it could easily be
(mostly) automated and even controlled by a nice touch friendly GUI to pick the
source device, etc.

I thought I would write up a quick post on this because when I finally got my
music streaming through my laptop, it was exciting to know that I could actually
use this to make a car computer with bluetooth functionality quite easily. I
used `AudioSource` in this example, but the other fun option is the
`HandsFreeGateway`, where instead of streaming stereo sound for music, it will
also connect the microphone from the computer to the phone to be used in-call,
etc.
