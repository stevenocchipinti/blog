I recently wrote small [Ruby
Gem](https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/tramtracker) that provides a command
line interface to Melbourne's [TramTracker
service](http://yarratrams.com.au/tramtracker).

One main feature I wanted was to allow the script to poll TramTracker on a
regular basis.  
In the past, I used the command line utility watch to achieve this, but I
couldn't find a way to enforce a "max iterations" option. If it gets forgotten
about in the background, TramTracker will eventually block that IP address!

So I turned to Ruby. Now instead of printing the same block of text over and
over again and filling up the terminal, I thought it would be better to just
have that text overwrite itself in place.

In this post, I'll outline a couple of ways of achieving this.

## Using the \b (backspace) character

Printing a \b character does a similar thing as pressing backspace, except
instead of removing the character, it nondestructively shifts the cursor back
which allows you to then overwrite previously written characters. This is really
simple to use and is great for little "progress" spinners.  
For example, a character that cycles through `|`, `/`, `-`, `\`:

```ruby
puts "foo\b"
# => foo
puts "foo\bx"
# => fox
puts "foo\b\b\bbar"
# => bar
1.step {|i| sleep 0.2; print "\b" + "|/-\\"[i%4] }
# => Cheesy, old-school spinner
```

There are two main shortfalls with this approach, one is that it only works on a
single line and two is that if you want to overwrite lots of characters, you'd
need just as many `\b` characters (you would probably introduce a loop).

```ruby
puts "foo\n\b\b\bbar"
# => foo\nbar
```

## Using the \r (carriage return) character

To avoid having to repeat just as many `\b` characters, a simple alternative
would be to return the cursor to the start of the line and write over the top of
the existing characters. For example:

```ruby
100.times {|p| print "\rDownloading %#{p+1}..."; sleep 1}
```

This approach still won't work across multiple lines, but it has another subtle
shortfall too, it doesn't clear the entire line. For example:

```
puts "foo\rp"
# => poo
```

A common work around for this is to pad the end of the string with spaces, but
there are better ways (keep reading ;) )

## Using curses

The most common answer to overwriting characters across multiple lines, is to
use [curses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library\)). Curses
allows you to pick exactly with character you want to update and makes [menu
driven Text User
Interfaces](https://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=command+line+curses&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.47534661,d.aGc&biw=1366&bih=679&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=r0WzUbyWF4T-iAfn8IH4DA)
(TUI's) easier to develop. Ruby happens to have a [curses
module](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/curses/rdoc/Curses.html) built
in to its standard library, which provides a simple API, for example:

```ruby
setpos(lines/2, cols/2) # Start in the middle
addstr("Hello world")
```

I created a more complete (simple) example of using curses in a [gist
here](https://gist.github.com/stevenocchipinti/5703381).

Curses is pretty good for this sort of stuff, it gives you a lot for free. The
thing that I didn't like about using the curses library was that when it
initialises, it clears the screen. This behaviour suits a TUI, and the old
contents is still restored when you return, but I was being picky and didn't
want that.

## Using individual cursor movement characters

This last option is the most fundamental of the bunch. Terminals generally
support characters that will allow you to move the cursor around at will and
would be the basis of things like curses, although not as commonly used. Here
are the most common characters to move the cursor around:

```
\033[<L>;<C>H # Move the cursor to line L, column C
\033[<N>A     # Move the cursor up N lines
\033[<N>B     # Move the cursor down N lines
\033[<N>C     # Move the cursor forward N columns
\033[<N>D     # Move the cursor backward N columns
\033[2J       # Clear the screen, move to (0,0)
\033[K        # Erase to end of line
```

You can read more about these "escape sequences"
[here](http://www.linuxselfhelp.com/howtos/Bash-Prompt/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.2).
I ended up using the `\033[K` ("Erase to end of line") and the `\033[A` ("Move
the cursor up") [characters in my TramTracker
gem](https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/tramtracker/blob/master/lib/formatters/polling_formatter.rb)
and it worked a treat!

Now go and make a cool retro user interface! :)
