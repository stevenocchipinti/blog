The way my desk is positioned means that when I’m on my computer I face the
corner of the room, which means the door is behind me. Quite often I’ll stay up
late working away till early hours of the morning and usually music comes
hand-in-hand with coding (for me anyway), so when it’s late, I use headphones so
I don’t disturb anyone else.

This has caused me some grief as sometimes someone will come into my room for
whatever reason and find me with my back to the them and headphones in, so
knocking at the door or saying my name does not get my attention. This leaves
the last resort of tapping me on the shoulder which scares the crap out of me!

A while ago I invested in a convex mirror designed to go on your computer screen
so you can see who’s coming up from behind. Well, with a 24-inch screen and
deep concentration, this small mirror doesn’t catch me eye at all, so I still
hit the ceiling when someone taps me on the shoulder.

For my birthday I got this amazing [Astro
A40](http://www.astrogaming.com/a40-audio-system-astro-edition) headset. Sound
clarity is absolutely stunning, they are really comfortable to wear and they
block out a lot of surrounding background noise. While I absolutely love the
headset and wear it all the time, you can probably guess this adds to my
jumpy-ness!

So I finally found a solution!

There is a package in the Ubuntu repositories called `motion` - which is a
really simple motion detection server that utilises a webcam. I had a look at
`zoneminder` too, but it seems very over-kill for my needs. `motion` will detect
movement (above a configurable threshold), store `movement` snapshots and video
files, log to a database and more importantly it provides a few hooks to fire
commands upon events such as `on_event_start`, `on_motion_detected`, etc.

I disabled almost every option except the `on_event_start` hook. This hook will
execute the given command when motion has been detected after a (configurable)
`gap` period of time of no motion - which I set to 10 seconds.

The command I set it to execute is this:

```
sudo -u steve notify-send –hint=int:transient:1 -i ‘/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/mimetypes/text-x-apport.svg’ ‘LOOK BEHIND YOU!’
```

As mentioned in an [earlier blog
post](https://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/09/gtalksms.html), notify-send can
be found in the libnotify-bin package

Note: the `–hint=int:transient:1` is for Gnome-Shell which has introduced
persistent notifcations and I didn’t want to acknowledge a notification
everytime someone walks past!

The end result of this little hack is when someone walks anywhere near my
doorway, that command gets my attention with a standard Gnome-Shell notification
from the bottom of the screen like this:

The reason I am using sudo here is that motion needs to be run as root, and so
the `notify-send` command will also be run as root. I guess because I had Unity
installed before Gnome-Shell, when root runs `notify-send` I get the Unity style
notifications - which is still nice, but as I’m road testing Gnome-Shell, I
figured I may as well use its notification look-n-feel too.

Here’s what it looks like if you leave out the `sudo -u steve` part:
