title: "Using netrw instead of NERDTree for Vim"

I'm going to attempt to use netrw exclusively for a while instead of NERDTree.
Mainly because not everyone has NERDTree, but everyone I work with will
generally have netrw installed by default so I thought I should be become more
proficient with it.

This post should provide me something I can quickly refer back to when I get
stuck. Netrw has a lot of features and the help page is pretty comprehensive.
It's worth a quick look, at least at the table of contents. It's available by
typing `:help netrw`.

There is also a quick reference for the mapping by typing `:help netrw-quickmap`
and one for the commands by typing `:help netrw-quickcom`.

## Navigation

Navigating around netrw is pretty intuitive, you use the arrows (or hjkl) to
move around and `enter` to open files or directories. These windows are just
like any other window in vim so most of the usual motions, etc. work except
netrw adds some default mappings. Here are the basics for navigation:

`enter` - Open files/directories  
`-` - Go up one directory  
`u` - Go back to previously visited directory (like `<C-o>` in vim)  
`U` - Go forward to subsequently visited directory (like `<C-i>` in vim)

`enter` works just fine to open files and directories, but there are some other
options available too:

`o` - Open file/directory in new horizontal split  
`v` - Open file/directory in new vertical split  
`t` - Open file/directory in new tab  
`p` - Preview file without (moving the cursor from netrw)  
`x` - Open the file/directory with the default system app

## Appearance and Behaviour

One of the first things I noticed when making the switch was when you press
`enter` on a directory, instead of displaying the contents of the sub-directory
inline, it would replace the whole buffer with the contents of the
sub-directory.

This is because by default netrw doesn't use a tree to display the
files/directories, its more like doing an `ls` but you can configure netrw to
print a tree and have the same behaviour as NERDTree with this mapping:

`i` - Cycle between different listing modes (one of them is tree mode)

- In normal mode, `enter` will move into and show the given file/directory
- In tree mode, `enter` will show the contents of the sub-directory in addition

While netrw doesn't look as nice as NERDTree, it still has a lot of options to
customize the way it looks and works.

`I` - Toggle the banner  
`c` - Make the browsing directory the current working directory  
`gn` - Make the directory under the cursor the top of the tree  
`gh` - Toggle hidden files on or off  
`a` - Cycle between all files, not hidden files or just hidden files visible  
`s` - Cycle sort order between name, time or filesize  
`r` - Reverse sort order

## File Operations

It's also pretty easy to do basic file operations:

`%` - Create a new file  
`d` - Create a new directory  
`D` - Delete the file/directory under the cursor (or marked files/dirs)  
`R` - Rename/move file/directory

Copying files however is a little more involved. You need to mark the files you
want to copy, mark the destination, then execute the operation (a little
tedious):

`mf` - Toggle whether the file/directory is marked  
`mt` - Mark the directory under the cursor as the copy target  
`mc` - Execute the copy operation  
`mu` - Unmark all marked items

## Commands

To open netrw is easy. You can use all the same commands you would use to open a
file except give them a directory. You can use the command line with `vim .` or
within vim with the commands below. These commands don't even need a space
between it and its arguments, so its very few keystrokes:

`:e.` - Open the current directory normally  
`:sp.` - Open the current directory in a horizontal split  
`:vs.` - Open the current directory in a vertical split  
`:tabe.` - Open the current directory in a new tab

These will all work, unless you have installed an alternative explorer plugin
(like NERDTree), in which case you can explicitly open netrw with `:Ntree`.

Netrw also provides a lot of different ways to launch an explorer window. The
most common command is `:Explore` which will open netrw in the directory of the
currently open file, much like the `:NERDTreeFind` command. Here are some
variations of that command:

`:Ex` - Use current buffer if available, otherwise split horizontally  
`:Ex!` - Use current buffer if available, otherwise split vertically

`:Sex!` - Horizontal split  
`:Hex` - Horizontal split  
`:Hex!` - Horizontal split (opposite side)

`:Sex` - Vertical split  
`:Vex` - Vertical split  
`:Vex!` - Vertical split (opposite side)

`:Tex` - New tab, directory of currently open buffer

There is another variation that doesn't use the directory of currently open
buffer but uses the current working directory. This is one is the most similar
to the default `:NERDTree` command.

`:Lex` - Vertical split full height, current working directory  
`:Lex!` - Vertical split, current working directory (opposite side)

All these commands can also take a directory as an argument.

## Basic Configuration

I didn't want to customize too much because that would defeat the purpose of the
learning the defaults, but I did want to turn off that banner (it was handy
having the basic operations on display, but I don't think I need it anymore).

```vim
let g:netrw_banner=0
let g:netrw_list_hide = '\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+,\(^\|\s\s\)ntuser\.\S\+'
autocmd FileType netrw set nolist
```

## More Features

There is more to explore with netrw, such as working with bookmarks and pattern
listings, but this post should have enough of the basics to be productive.
Checkout `:help netrw` for more features.
