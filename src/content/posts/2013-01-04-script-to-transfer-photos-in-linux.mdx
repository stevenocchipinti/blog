Every time I go on holiday, I end up writing the same bash script! … I know, how
nerdy is that, I code on holidays.

I really should save the script and bring it with me each time, instead I just
re-invent the wheel everytime, so I thought I would write a quick post to record
it for next time.  
Luckily it’s a really simple script to write, all it does is
move the photos from my camera’s memory card to the laptop HDD, but it puts them
in a sub-directory for that particular day, then sorts the files into a `jpg` or
`raw` sub-directory.

```
#!/bin/bash

DATE=`date +%Y%m%d`
SDCARD="/media/steve/NIKON D90/DCIM"

mkdir -p $DATE/{jpg,raw}
find "$SDCARD" -name "*.JPG" -exec mv -v {} "$DATE/jpg" \;
find "$SDCARD" -name "*.NEF" -exec mv -v {} "$DATE/raw" \;
notify-send "Finished transferring photos!"
```

The script is quite dumb, it just creates a directory for the current date. On
one of the trips, I had the script pull the date the photo was taken from the
EXIF information, but when a series of photos goes over mid-night, it splits
them up and I didn’t really like that.
