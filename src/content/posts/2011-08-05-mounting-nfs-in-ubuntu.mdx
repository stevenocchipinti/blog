At home we have a NAS that supports NFS!

Its quite easy to setup Ubuntu (11.04) as an NFS client - this will allow you to mount the NAS on your local filesystem and it will appear just like any other directory.

First step is to install the `nfs-common` package:

```
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
```

You can now mount NFS volumes!  
To do so temporarily, can use this command:

```
sudo mount.nfs <IPADDRESS>:<REMOTEPATH> <MOUNTPOINT>
```

The mount point needs to exist prior to mounting.  
For example, my nas would be mounted as follows:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/nas
sudo mount.nfs 192.168.1.10:/nfs/Public /mnt/nas
```

To make this permanent, you would need to add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:

```
192.168.1.10:/nfs/Public  /mnt/NAS  nfs  defaults  0  0
```

As a bonus, this also allows you to use the mount and umount commands by just specifying the mount point as these commands will query the `/etc/fstab` file.

For example, once your `/etc/fstab` file is up to date, these commands will work without specifying the remote host and path:

```
sudo umount /mnt/nas
sudo mount /mnt/nas
```
