A lot of people are scared of learning of vim because of the initial learning
curve.

When learning vim for the first time there are lots of approaches, but two
common ways are:

1. Learn "pure" vi/vim, then introduce vimrc options and then plugins
2. Start with an existing "customization" (from someone else), then learn what
   things do

Once upon a time, I would have suggested learning the basic features of vim
before getting into customization, but there are quite a lot of people who are
not interested in learning the tool unless they can be productive straight away.
When coming from an IDE, the apparent shortcomings of a less integrated text
editor will scare them away before they have discovered the power of editing
text with vim.

This guide is aimed at those people. I want to outline some steps to learn vim
that makes the transition from IDE to vim as easy as possible with the hope of
making vim a less scary step.

## Installing Vim

Most systems will come with a version of vim, but you may want to get the latest
version from the systems package manager for a more complete feature set.

On a mac, the standard install of `vim` is missing clipboard support so I would
recommend installing MacVim, here is how I do it with homebrew:

```
brew install macvim
brew linkapps
```

This package provides `mvim` on the command line, but `vim` will still refer to
the system version, so I setup a couple of aliases in my `.bash_profile`:

```
alias vim="mvim -v"
alias vi="vim"
```

## Basic Usage

This guide is more about setting up vim in a manner that won't seem too
crippling when coming from an IDE, so I won't focus too much on editing
effectively with vim here.

If vim is completely new to you and you don't know the basics such as the
difference between _command mode_ and _insert mode_ or how to quit vim, I would
recommend pausing the guide here and running `vimtutor` in your terminal to
learn the basics.

## Configuring Vim

Vim uses a `.vimrc` configuration file in your home directory. There is a
plethora of configuration options you can put here, but I thought I would offer
some basic options to get you started.

My [`.vimrc`](https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/dotvim/blob/master/vimrc) is
quite large, but here is a snippet for some basic options that you can put into
your own `.vimrc` to get started:

```
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on

set ts=2 sw=2         " Use 2 spaces for tabs
set expandtab         " Use spaces instead of tab characters
set wrap              " Wrap the display lines (not actual text)
set linebreak
set backspace=indent,eol,start
set incsearch         " Show matching search results as typing
set ruler             " Show row and column in status bar
set wildmenu          " Nicer tab completion for :ex commands
set ignorecase        " Case insensitive search by default
set smartcase         " Use case sensitive search in a capital letter is used
set warn              " Show what mode your in (insert, etc.)
set scrolloff=3       " Number of lines to always show at at the top and bottom
set autoindent        " Copy the indentation from the previous line
set colorcolumn=81    " Highlight the 81st column (shorthand = :set cc=81)
set cursorline        " Highlight the line which the cursor is on
set laststatus=2      " Always show a status bar
set mouse=a           " Make the mouse work - even in terminals
set list              " Show `listchars` characters
set listchars=tab:=»,trail:·

" Easier way to copy and paste from the global clipboard
map <leader>p "+p
map <leader>y "+y
```

## Navigating code

Vim has builtin support for `ctags`, which indexes your code and allows you to
jump to the definition of a method or class. As usual, on a mac you will have a
standard version of `ctags` installed, but it's not very good, so I recommend
installing the _exuberant ctags_ package from homebrew:

```
brew install ctags
sudo mv /usr/bin/ctags{,-bsd}
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/ctags/5.8/bin/ctags /usr/bin/ctags
```

To make use of ctags, in the root of a project run the following command:

```
ctags -R .
```

This will need to be run when the code changes to keep the tags file up to date,
so I have setup [git
hooks](http://tbaggery.com/2011/08/08/effortless-ctags-with-git.html) to
automate this. If you don't want to setup git hooks, you can execute this
command from within vim with `:!ctags -R .`

Now if you open some code, move your cursor over an occurrence of a method or
class, you can jump into the definition of that method or class with the
following key bindings:

`crtl` + `]` = Jump to definition (of what is under the cursor)  
`crtl` + `T` = Jump back from following a tag

The following key bindings are also useful for navigation and do _not_ require
ctags:

`/foo` = Search for `foo`  
`*` = Search for the word under the cursor  
`n` = Jump to the next occurrence of the search  
`N` = Jump to the previous occurrence of the search  
`crtl` + `o` = Go back from the last jump  
`crtl` + `i` = Go forward to the recent jump

## Vim Plugins

Vim has a plugin system, but by default it does not do a good job of keeping
plugins isolated from each other. To improve this, there are plugins that manage
plugins. I recommend using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), here is
how to set it up along with a few useful vim plugins:

```
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
```

Then place the following at the top of your `.vimrc`:

```
filetype off
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
call vundle#rc()

Plugin 'gmarik/vundle'
Plugin 'kien/ctrlp.vim'
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-rails'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-rake'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-commentary'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-repeat'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plugin 'vim-scripts/matchit.zip'
Plugin 'scrooloose/syntastic'
Plugin 'bogado/file-line'

call vundle#end()
filetype plugin indent on
```

Then, I choose configure some of those plugins towards the bottom of the
`.vimrc` like this:

```
" NERDTREE PLUGIN - (mnemonic: Files)
nmap <leader>f :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
nmap <leader>F :NERDTreeFind<CR>

" CTRL-P PLUGIN
let g:ctrlp_user_command = {
\   'types': {
\     1: ['.git/', 'cd %s && git ls-files'],
\     2: ['.hg/', 'hg --cwd %s locate -I .'],
\   },
\   'fallback': 'find %s -type f'
\ }
```

Now, from within vim, run `:BundleInstall`

## Next steps

At this point, you should have a somewhat powerful installation of vim, the next
step is to learn how to use this power. Below are some resources to help you
learn how to use vim effectively.
